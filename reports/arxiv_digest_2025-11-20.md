### [Constraint-preserving quantum algorithm for the multi-frequency antenna placement problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15566v1)
**Authors:** Matteo Vandelli, Francesco Ferrari, Daniele Dragoni  
**Published:** 2025-11-19  
**Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math.OC  

**Abstract:** Quantum algorithms for combinatorial optimization typically encode constraints as soft penalties within the objective function, which can reduce efficiency and scalability compared to state-of-the-art classical methods that instead exploit constraints to guide the search toward high-quality solutions. Although solving this issue for an arbitrary problem is inherently a hard task, we address this c...

**Authors:** Marco Ballarin, Juan José García-Ripoll, David Hayes et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-19  
**Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** For the preparation of high-dimensional functions on quantum computers, we introduce tensor network algorithms that are efficient with regard to dimensionality, optimize circuits composed of hardware-native gates and take gate errors into account during the optimization. To avoid the notorious barren plateau problem of vanishing gradients in the circuit optimization, we smoothly transform the circ...

### [Gleason's Theorem for a Qubit as Part of a Composite System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15607v1)
**Authors:** Vincenzo Fiorentino, Stefan Weigert  
**Published:** 2025-11-19  
**Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We extend Gleason's theorem to the two-dimensional Hilbert space of a qubit by invoking the standard axiom that describes composite quantum systems. The tensor-product structure allows us to derive density matrices and Born's rule for $d=2$ from a simple requirement: the probabilities assigned to measurement outcomes must not depend on whether a system is considered on its own or as a subsystem of...

### [Tokenisation over Bounded Alphabets is Hard](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15709v1)
**Authors:** Violeta Kastreva, Philip Whittington, Dennis Komm et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-19  
**Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.DS, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Recent works have shown that tokenisation is NP-complete. However, these works assume tokenisation is applied to inputs with unboundedly large alphabets -- an unrealistic assumption, given that in practice tokenisers operate over fixed-size alphabets, such as bytes or Unicode characters. We close this gap by analysing tokenisation over bounded $n$-ary alphabets, considering two natural variants: b...

**Published:** 2025-11-19  
**Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Strong reasoning capabilities can now be achieved by large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without any supervised fine-tuning. Although post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT) are well studied in the context of fine-tuning, how quantization impacts RL in large reasoning models (LRMs) remains an open question. To answer this question, we conducted systematic experim...

### [Exponential Suppression of Transport in Electric Quantum Walks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15664v1)
**Authors:** Houssam Abdul-Rahman, Christopher Cedzich, Günter Stolz et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-19  
**Updated:** 2025-11-19  
**Categories:** math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We establish exact scalings for the maximal group velocity of translation-invariant quantum walks in periodic electric fields. Our main result shows that the maximal group velocity decays exponentially with the period of the field in the whole parameter range, thus affirming a conjecture of arXiv:2302.01869 and at the same time augmenting it to an exact equality. We further demonstrate explicit re...
