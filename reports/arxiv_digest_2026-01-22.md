### [Explaining the advantage of quantum-enhanced physics-informed neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15046v1)
**Authors:** Nils Klement, Veronika Eyring, Mierk Schwabe  
**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the backbone of simulations of many natural phenomena, for example in climate modeling, material science, and even financial markets. The application of physics-informed neural networks to accelerate the solution of PDEs is promising, but not competitive with numerical solvers yet. Here, we show how quantum computing can improve the ability of physics-inf...

**Authors:** Patrick Navez, Valentina Di Meo, Berardo Ruggiero et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Superconducting qubit networks (SQNs) embedded in a low-dissipative resonator is a promising device allowing one not only to establish the collective quantum dynamics on a macroscopic scale but also to greatly enhance the sensitivity of detectors of microwave photons. A quantum ac Stark effect provided by coupling between an SQN and microwave photons of a resonator, leads to a strong nonlinear int...

### [RayRoPE: Projective Ray Positional Encoding for Multi-view Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15275v1)
**Authors:** Yu Wu, Minsik Jeon, Jen-Hao Rick Chang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We study positional encodings for multi-view transformers that process tokens from a set of posed input images, and seek a mechanism that encodes patches uniquely, allows SE(3)-invariant attention with multi-frequency similarity, and can be adaptive to the geometry of the underlying scene. We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above des...

### [Trimer Dynamics in Floquet-driven arrays of Rydberg Atoms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15162v1)
**Authors:** Edoardo Tiburzi, Lorenzo Maffi, Luca Dell'Anna et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We analyze the WAHUHA Floquet protocol recently applied to arrays of Rydberg atoms and derive beyond-leading-order corrections in the high-frequency expansion of the effective spin theory. We find that an appropriate choice of the pulses times can enforce an approximate symmetry corresponding to the conservation of the total magnetization. The interaction channels emerging from higher-order Floque...

### [Precision Enhancement in Transient Quantum Thermometry:Cold-Probe Bias and Its Removal](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15237v1)
**Authors:** Debarupa Saha, Ujjwal Sen  
**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We unveil a temperature bias of the probe in transient quantum thermometry under Markovian dynamics. Specifically, for qubit thermometers evolving under Markovian dynamics, we show that enhanced precision beyond the steady state limit can be achieved if and only if the probe is initially colder than the thermal state corresponding to the bath temperature to be estimated. In contrast, this temperat...

### [Superluminal Transformations and Indeterminism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15263v1)
**Authors:** Amrapali Sen, Flavio Del Santo  
**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph, gr-qc, physics.hist-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quan...

**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We study the problem of estimating causal effects under hidden confounding in the following unpaired data setting: we observe some covariates $X$ and an outcome $Y$ under different experimental conditions (environments) but do not observe them jointly; we either observe $X$ or $Y$. Under appropriate regularity conditions, the problem can be cast as an instrumental variable (IV) regression with the...

**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, math.ST  

**Abstract:** Principal component analysis (PCA) is a tool to capture factors that explain variation in data. Across domains, data are now collected across multiple contexts (for example, individuals with different diseases, cells of different types, or words across texts). While the factors explaining variation in data are undoubtedly shared across subsets of contexts, no tools currently exist to systematicall...

### [Purcell enhanced electroluminescence of a unipolar light emitting quantum device at 10 micron](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15193v1)
**Authors:** Marta Mastrangelo, Djamal Gacemi, Axel Evirgen et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Efficient generation of radiation in the mid- and far- infrared relies primarily on lasers and coherent nonlinear optical phenomena driven by lasers. This wavelength range lacks of luminescent devices because the spontaneous emission rate becomes much longer than the nonradiative energy relaxation processes and therefore emitters have to count on stimulated emission produced by linear or non-linea...

**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** math.OC, math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Leveraging a recently proposed notion of relative entropy in general probabilistic theories (GPT), we prove a finite de Finetti representation theorem for general convex bodies. We apply this result to address a fundamental question in polynomial optimization: the existence of a convergent outer hierarchy for problems with inequality constraints and analytical convergence guarantees. Our strategy ...

**Published:** 2026-01-21  
**Updated:** 2026-01-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In an entanglement summoning task, a set of distributed, co-operating parties attempt to fulfill requests to prepare entanglement between distant locations. The parties share limited communication resources: timing constraints may require the entangled state be prepared before some pairs of distant parties can communicate, and a restricted set of links in a quantum network may further constrain co...
