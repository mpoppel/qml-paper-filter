### [Kernel Learning for Regression via Quantum Annealing Based Spectral Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08724v1)
**Authors:** Yasushi Hasegawa, Masayuki Ohzeki  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** While quantum annealing (QA) has been developed for combinatorial optimization, practical QA devices operate at finite temperature and under noise, and their outputs can be regarded as stochastic samples close to a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution. In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling b...

### [Single-Period Floquet Control of Bosonic Codes with Quantum Lattice Gates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08782v1)
**Authors:** Tangyou Huang, Lei Du, Lingzhen Guo  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Bosonic codes constitute a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum computing. {Existing Floquet protocols enable analytical construction of bosonic codes but typically rely on slow adiabatic ramps with thousands of driving periods.} In this work, we circumvent this bottleneck by introducing an analytical and deterministic Floquet method that directly synthesizes arbitrary unitaries within a sing...

### [Enhancing classical simulation with noisy quantum devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08772v1)
**Authors:** Ruiqi Zhang, Fuchuan Wei, Zhaohui Wei  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** As quantum devices continue to improve in scale and precision, a central challenge is how to effectively utilize noisy hardware for meaningful computation. Most existing approaches aim to recover noiseless circuit outputs from noisy ones through error mitigation or correction. Here, we show that noisy quantum devices can be directly leveraged as computational resources to enhance the classical sim...

### [Optimal logical Bell measurements on stabilizer codes with linear optics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08820v1)
**Authors:** Simon D. Reiß, Peter van Loock  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Bell measurements (BMs) are ubiquitous in quantum information and technology. They are basic elements for quantum commmunication, computation, and error correction. In particular, when performed on logical qubits encoded in physical photonic qubits, they allow for a read-out of stabilizer syndrome information to enhance loss tolerance in qubit-state transmission and fusion. However, even in an ide...

### [Local Magnetometry from Measurement-Induced Dissipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08762v1)
**Authors:** Rishith Reddy, Parveen Kumar, Ankur Das  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Magnetic phases are commonly identified through macroscopic magnetization, yet many ordered states, including antiferromagnets and altermagnets, possess a vanishing net moment despite distinct local spin structure. We show that such an order can be accessed through the measurement-induced steady state of a single primary qubit locally coupled to a spin lattice. Using a controlled primary-ancillary...

### [Multiplex Thinking: Reasoning via Token-wise Branch-and-Merge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08808v1)
**Authors:** Yao Tang, Li Dong, Yaru Hao et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate token...

**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The CLASSIX algorithm is a fast and explainable approach to data clustering. In its original form, this algorithm exploits the sorting of the data points by their first principal component to truncate the search for nearby data points, with nearness being defined in terms of the Euclidean distance. Here we extend CLASSIX to other distance metrics, including the Manhattan distance and the Tanimoto ...

**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.GT  

**Abstract:** Aligning large language models (LLMs) to serve users with heterogeneous and potentially conflicting preferences is a central challenge for personalized and trustworthy AI. We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, wh...

### [Rewarding the Rare: Uniqueness-Aware RL for Creative Problem Solving in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08763v1)
**Authors:** Zhiyuan Hu, Yucheng Wang, Yufei He et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs), particularly for complex reasoning tasks, yet it often suffers from exploration collapse: policies prematurely concentrate on a small set of dominant reasoning patterns, improving pass@1 while limiting rollout-level diversity and gains in pass@k. We argue that this failure stems from regulariz...

**Authors:** Matt Kovacs-Deak, Daochen Wang, Rain Zimin Yang  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** cs.CC, cs.DM, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We prove that $\mathrm{deg}(f) \leq 2 \, \mathrm{rdeg}(f)^4$ for every Boolean function $f$, where $\mathrm{deg}(f)$ is the degree of $f$ and $\mathrm{rdeg}(f)$ is the rational degree of $f$. This resolves the second of the three open problems stated by Nisan and Szegedy, and attributed to Fortnow, in 1994.

### [Superadditivity of Krylov Complexity for Tensor Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08723v1)
**Authors:** Jeff Murugan, Hendrik J. R. van Zyl  
**Published:** 2026-01-13  
**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study Krylov complexity for quantum systems whose Hamiltonians factorise as tensor products. We prove that complexity is superadditive under tensor products, $C_{12}\ge C_1+C_2$, and identify a positive operator that quantifies the resulting excess complexity. The underlying mechanism is made transparent by introducing a Krylov graph representation in which tensor products generate a higher-dim...

**Updated:** 2026-01-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** For a given quantum state used in sensing, the quantum Cramér-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable by an unbiased estimator of an unknown parameter, determined by the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI serves as an upper bound on the classical Fisher information (CFI), representing the maximum extractable information about the unknown paramete...
