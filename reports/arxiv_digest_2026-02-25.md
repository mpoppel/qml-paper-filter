### [Quantum Approximate Optimization for Decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21124v1)
**Authors:** Krishnakanta Barik, Goutam Paul  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Decoding Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes is a fundamental problem in coding theory, and Belief Propagation (BP) is one of the most popular methods for LDPC code decoding. However, BP may encounter convergence issues and suboptimal performance, especially for short-length codes and in high-noise channels. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a type of Variational Quantum A...

### [Quantum feedback algorithms for DNA assembly using FALQON variants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21080v1)
**Authors:** Pedro M. Prado, Lucas A. M. Rattighieri, Rafael Simões do Carmo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Reconstructing DNA sequences without a reference, known as de novo assembly, is a complex computational task involving the alignment of overlapping fragments. To address this problem, a usual strategy is to map the assembly to a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation, which can be solved by different quantum algorithms. In this work, we focus on three versions of the Feedba...

### [Correcting coherent quantum errors by going with the flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21076v1)
**Authors:** Wayne M. Witzel, Anand Ganti, Tzvetan S. Metodi  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The performance of a given quantum error correction (QEC) code depends upon the noise model that is assumed. Independent Pauli noise, applied after each quantum operation, is a simplistic noise model that is easy to simulate and understand in the context of stabilizer codes. Although such a noise model is artificial, it is equivalent to independent, random, unbiased qubit rotations. What about spa...

### [Restriction-Based Certificate of Bipartite Schmidt Rank in Hypergraph States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21016v1)
**Authors:** C. Fajardo, M. Paraschiv  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate bipartite entanglement in qubit hypergraph states across an arbitrary fixed bipartition. Using the real equally weighted (REW) representation, the Schmidt rank across the cut can be computed as the real rank of a phase-cleaned cross-cut sign matrix. Whereas graph states admit an exact cut-rank rule, because the cross-cut phase is purely bilinear, hypergraph states typically contain ...

### [Test-Time Training with KV Binding Is Secretly Linear Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21204v1)
**Authors:** Junchen Liu, Sven Elflein, Or Litany et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Test-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as a form of online meta-learning that memorizes a key-value mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be e...

### [Squint: Fast Visual Reinforcement Learning for Sim-to-Real Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21203v1)
**Authors:** Abdulaziz Almuzairee, Henrik I. Christensen  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Visual reinforcement learning is appealing for robotics but expensive -- off-policy methods are sample-efficient yet slow; on-policy methods parallelize well but waste samples. Recent work has shown that off-policy methods can train faster than on-policy methods in wall-clock time for state-based control. Extending this to vision remains challenging, where high-dimensional input images complicate ...

### [Learning from Trials and Errors: Reflective Test-Time Planning for Embodied LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21198v1)
**Authors:** Yining Hong, Huang Huang, Manling Li et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** Embodied LLMs endow robots with high-level task reasoning, but they cannot reflect on what went wrong or why, turning deployment into a sequence of independent trials where mistakes repeat rather than accumulate into experience. Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: \textit{reflection-in-action}, where the...

### [Untied Ulysses: Memory-Efficient Context Parallelism via Headwise Chunking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21196v1)
**Authors:** Ravi Ghadia, Maksim Abraham, Sergei Vorobyov et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DC  

**Abstract:** Efficiently processing long sequences with Transformer models usually requires splitting the computations across accelerators via context parallelism. The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techni...

**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DS, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We study the complexity of smoothed agnostic learning, recently introduced by~\cite{CKKMS24}, in which the learner competes with the best classifier in a target class under slight Gaussian perturbations of the inputs. Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem...

**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Pass@k is a widely used performance metric for verifiable large language model tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and short-answer reasoning. It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a rec...

**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Uniform-state discrete diffusion models excel at few-step generation and guidance due to their ability to self-correct, making them preferred over autoregressive or Masked diffusion models in these settings. However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that genera...

### [Not Just How Much, But Where: Decomposing Epistemic Uncertainty into Per-Class Contributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21160v1)
**Authors:** Mame Diarra Toure, David A. Stephens  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.AP, stat.ME  

**Abstract:** In safety-critical classification, the cost of failure is often asymmetric, yet Bayesian deep learning summarises epistemic uncertainty with a single scalar, mutual information (MI), that cannot distinguish whether a model's ignorance involves a benign or safety-critical class. We decompose MI into a per-class vector $C_k(x)=σ_k^{2}/(2μ_k)$, with $μ_k{=}\mathbb{E}[p_k]$ and $σ_k^2{=}\mathrm{Var}[p...

**Abstract:** Hydrodynamic reformulations of the Schrödinger equation suggest an interpretation of quantum mechanics in terms of a fluid flowing on configuration space. In the discrete hydrodynamic view, this fluid is not fundamental but emerges from many underlying microscopic fluid components whose collective behavior reproduces quantum phenomena. The most developed realization of this idea is the discrete ma...

### [Tool Building as a Path to "Superintelligence"](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21061v1)
**Authors:** David Koplow, Tomer Galanti, Tomaso Poggio

**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The Diligent Learner framework suggests LLMs can achieve superintelligence via test-time search, provided a sufficient step-success probability $γ$. In this work, we design a benchmark to measure $γ$ on logical out-of-distribution inference. We construct a class of tasks involving GF(2) circuit reconstruction that grow more difficult with each reasoning step, and that are, from an information-theo...

### [Asynchronous Multi-photon Interference for Quantum Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21050v1)
**Authors:** Baghdasar Baghdasaryan, Karen Lozano-Méndez, Markus Leipe et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-24

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Advanced quantum communication protocols require high-visibility quantum interference between photons generated at distant nodes, which places stringent demands on optical synchronization. Conventionally, synchronization of optical wave packets relies on pulsed sources and precise optical path stabilization. An alternative approach employs continuous-wave (CW) photon-pair sources, where temporal i...

### [Telemetry-Based Server Selection in the Quantum Internet via Cross-Layer Runtime Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21007v1)
**Authors:** Masaki Nagai, Hideaki Kawaguchi, Shin Nishio et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.NI  

**Abstract:** The Quantum Internet will allow clients to delegate quantum workloads to remote servers over heterogeneous networks, but choosing the server that minimizes end-to-end execution time is difficult because server processing, feedforward classical communication, and entanglement distribution can overlap in protocol-dependent ways and shift the runtime bottleneck. We propose $T_{\max}$, a lightweight r...

### [Internal dynamics and guided motion in general relativistic quantum interferometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21001v1)
**Authors:** Thomas B. Mieling  
**Published:** 2026-02-24  
**Updated:** 2026-02-24  
**Categories:** gr-qc, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The coupling between internal degrees of freedom of quantum systems and their overall motion in an external gravitational field plays a central role in multiple extensions of Einstein's equivalence principle to quantum physics. While previous models of such effects were predominantly restricted to linearized gravity and often required the motion of quantum particles to follow prescribed world-line...
