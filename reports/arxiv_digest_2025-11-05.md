**Authors:** Ernesto Araya, Massimiliano Datres, Gitta Kutyniok  
**Published:** 2025-11-02  
**Updated:** 2025-11-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising paradigm for energy-efficient computation, yet their theoretical foundations-especially regarding stability and robustness-remain limited compared to artificial neural networks. In this work, we study discrete-time leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) SNNs through the lens of Boolean function analysis. We focus on noise sensitivity and stability in classifi...

**Abstract:** Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are widely used to reduce memory and computational costs in deep learning. However, existing implementations, including standard FFT and real FFT (rFFT), cannot achieve true in-place computation. In particular, rFFT maps an input of size n to a complex output of size n/2+1, causing dimensional mismatch and requiring additional memory allocation. We propose the first r...

**Abstract:** We develop new accelerated first-order algorithms in the Frank-Wolfe (FW) family for minimizing smooth convex functions over compact convex sets, with a focus on two prominent constraint classes: (1) polytopes and (2) matrix domains given by the spectrahedron and the unit nuclear-norm ball. A key technical ingredient is a complementarity condition that captures solution sparsity -- face dimension ...

**Authors:** Mohamed Bouadi, Pratinav Seth, Aditya Tanna et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-04  
**Updated:** 2025-11-04  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Tabular data remain the predominant format for real-world applications. Yet, developing effective neural models for tabular data remains challenging due to heterogeneous feature types and complex interactions occurring at multiple scales. Recent advances in tabular in-context learning (ICL), such as TabPFN and TabICL, have achieved state-of-the-art performance comparable to gradient-boosted trees ...

**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** As model context lengths continue to grow, concerns about whether models effectively use the full context length have persisted. While several carefully designed long-context evaluations have recently been released, these evaluations tend to rely on retrieval from one or more sections of the context, which allows nearly all of the context tokens to be disregarded as noise. This represents only one...

**Abstract:** In Major League Baseball, strategy and planning are major factors in determining the outcome of a game. Previous studies have aided this by building machine learning models for predicting the winning team of any given game. We extend this work by training a comprehensive set of machine learning models using a common dataset. In addition, we relate the win probabilities produced by these models to ...

**Abstract:** The study of real-time dynamics of fermions remains one of the last frontiers beyond the reach of classical simulations and is key to our understanding of quantum behavior in chemistry and materials, with implications for quantum technology. Here we introduce a Heisenberg-picture algorithm that propagates observables expressed in a Majorana-string basis using a truncation scheme that preserves Tro...

**Published:** 2025-11-04  
**Updated:** 2025-11-04  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemS...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Tabular foundation models represent a growing paradigm in structured data learning, extending the benefits of large-scale pretraining to tabular domains. However, their adoption remains limited due to heterogeneous preprocessing pipelines, fragmented APIs, inconsistent fine-tuning procedures, and the absence of standardized evaluation for deployment-oriented metrics such as calibration and fairnes...

**Published:** 2025-11-04  
**Updated:** 2025-11-04  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** By analysing the growth of Krylov complexity for some simple models, we find that the exponential growth of an operator in Hilbert space can be predicted from the off-diagonal decay of the operator matrix elements in the system eigenbasis. When the decay is exponential or slower, the Krylov complexity grows exponentially; when it is algebraic or slower, the growth rate is maximal. As a result, non...

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed training paradigm wherein participants collaborate to build a global model while ensuring the privacy of the involved data, which remains stored on participant devices. However, proposals aiming to ensure such privacy also make it challenging to protect against potential attackers seeking to compromise the training outcome. In this context, we present Fast,...

**Abstract:** We present a systematic study of subtraction in large language models (LLMs). While prior benchmarks emphasize addition and multiplication, subtraction has received comparatively little attention despite being structurally distinct as a non-commutative operation. We evaluate eight pretrained LLMs spanning four families on addition and subtraction problems. Our experiments reveal that subtraction a...

**Abstract:** Despite rapid growth in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), their reasoning traces remain opaque: it is often unclear which modality drives a prediction, how conflicts are resolved, or when one stream dominates. In this paper, we introduce modality sabotage, a diagnostic failure mode in which a high-confidence unimodal error overrides other evidence and misleads the fused result. To analyze ...

**Published:** 2025-11-04  
**Updated:** 2025-11-04  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Despite the popularity of the Adam optimizer in practice, most theoretical analyses study Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) as a proxy for Adam, and little is known about how the solutions found by Adam differ. In this paper, we show that Adam implicitly reduces a unique form of sharpness measure shaped by its adaptive updates, leading to qualitatively different solutions from SGD. More specifical...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We find a process satisfying the axioms of hyper-decoherence which produces standard quantum theory from the theory of quantum boxes (higher-order quantum theory with the non-signalling tensor product). This hyper-decoherence map evades the no-go theorem of Lee and Selby by relaxing constraints on signalling to the past and the uniqueness of purifications. We discuss some natural opposing conclusi...

**Abstract:** Ever since gravity-induced entanglement (GIE) experiments have been proposed as a witness of the quantum nature of gravity, more and more theories of classical gravity coupled to quantum matter have been shown to predict GIE, despite the existence of several theory-independent no-go theorems purportedly claiming that it should not be possible. This note explains why this is possible, and why this ...

**Abstract:** Superfluorescence, the cooperative burst of spontaneous emission from an ensemble of dipoles, arises when microscopic oscillators spontaneously synchronize their phases. Here we show that this process can be reversed in time within quantum materials. Coherent multidimensional spectroscopy of halide perovskite quantum dots reveals a delayed cooperative absorption burst, the mirror image of superflu...

By tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a first examp...

**Abstract:** We study the problem of learning multi-task, multi-agent policies for cooperative, temporal objectives, under centralized training, decentralized execution. In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited to the single-task case...

**Abstract:** Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) provide hardware-level security by exploiting intrinsic randomness to produce device-unique responses. However, machine learning and side-channel attacks increasingly undermine their classical assumptions, calling for new approaches to ensure unforgeability. Quantum mechanics naturally supports this goal through intrinsic randomness and the no-cloning theorem, ...
