**Abstract:** The transition to the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) presents a computational challenge where particle reconstruction complexity may outpace classical computing resources. While quantum computing offers potential speedups, standard algorithms like Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) require prohibitive circuit depths for near-term hardware. Here, we introduce the 1-Bit Quantum Filter, a do...

### [MHLA: Restoring Expressivity of Linear Attention via Token-Level Multi-Head](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07832v1)
**Authors:** Kewei Zhang, Ye Huang, Yufan Deng et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the origin...

### [Computing quantum magic of state vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07824v1)
**Authors:** Piotr Sierant, Jofre Vallès-Muns, Artur Garcia-Saez  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of many-body quantum states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational ...

**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.NE, q-bio.NC  

**Abstract:** Learning how to learn efficiently is a fundamental challenge for biological agents and a growing concern for artificial ones. To learn effectively, an agent must regulate its learning speed, balancing the benefits of rapid improvement against the costs of effort, instability, or resource use. We introduce a normative framework that formalizes this problem as an optimal control process in which the...

### [Benchmarking Small Language Models and Small Reasoning Language Models on System Log Severity Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07790v1)
**Authors:** Yahya Masri, Emily Ma, Zifu Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We a...

### [Disorder enhanced transport as a general feature of long-range hopping models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07787v1)
**Authors:** Elisa Zanardini, Giuseppe Luca Celardo, Nahum C. Chávez et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We analyze the interplay of disorder and long-range hopping in a paradigmatic one dimensional model of quantum transport. While typically the current is expected to decrease as the disorder strength increases due to localization effects, in systems with infinite range hopping it was shown in Chavez et al, Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 153201 (2021), that the current can increase with disorder in the Disor...

**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate the superradiant phase transition in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate with distinct atomic detunings, confined in an optical cavity and driven by a transverse pump laser. By combining perturbation theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the phase transition is dominated by the red-detuned component, resulting in a phase diagram completely different from that of...

### [Are LLM Decisions Faithful to Verbal Confidence?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07767v1)
**Authors:** Jiawei Wang, Yanfei Zhou, Siddartha Devic et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) can produce surprisingly sophisticated estimates of their own uncertainty. However, it remains unclear to what extent this expressed confidence is tied to the reasoning, knowledge, or decision making of the model. To test this, we introduce $\textbf{RiskEval}$: a framework designed to evaluate whether models adjust their abstention policies in response to varying error...

### [Free-RBF-KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with Adaptive Radial Basis Functions for Efficient Function Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07760v1)
**Authors:** Shao-Ting Chiu, Siu Wun Cheung, Ulisses Braga-Neto et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.NA  

**Abstract:** Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have shown strong potential for efficiently approximating complex nonlinear functions. However, the original KAN formulation relies on B-spline basis functions, which incur substantial computational overhead due to De Boor's algorithm. To address this limitation, recent work has explored alternative basis functions such as radial basis functions (RBFs) that can im...

### [Learning to bin: differentiable and Bayesian optimization for multi-dimensional discriminants in high-energy physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07756v1)
**Authors:** Johannes Erdmann, Nitish Kumar Kasaraguppe, Florian Mausolf  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** physics.data-an, cs.LG, hep-ex  

**Abstract:** Categorizing events using discriminant observables is central to many high-energy physics analyses. Yet, bin boundaries are often chosen by hand. A simple, popular choice is to apply argmax projections of multi-class scores and equidistant binning of one-dimensional discriminants. We propose a binning optimization for signal significance directly in multi-dimensional discriminants. We use a Gaussi...

**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Self-supervised pre-training with contrastive learning is a powerful method for learning from sparsely labeled data. However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is sub...

**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Many materials properties depend on higher-order derivatives of the potential energy surface, yet machine learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) trained with standard a standard loss on energy, force, and stress errors can exhibit error in curvature, degrading the prediction of vibrational properties. We introduce phonon fine-tuning (PFT), which directly supervises second-order force constants of ...

**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** math.NA, math-ph, math.CV, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Most numerical methods for time integration use real-valued time steps. Complex time steps, however, can provide an additional degree of freedom, as we can select the magnitude of the time step in both the real and imaginary directions. We show that specific paths in the complex time plane lead to expanded stability regions, providing clear computational advantages for complex-valued systems. In p...

### [Non Markovian Corrections to Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07689v1)
**Authors:** Ramandeep Dewan  
**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.soft  

**Abstract:** Tegmark's widely cited bound on decoherence times in biological systems is derived under the assumption of a delta correlated, memoryless environment. In this work we show that any finite environmental memory universally induces quadratic short time decoherence, in validating the exponential decay law at early times. For an Ornstein Uhlenbeck environment we derive a closed non markovian expression...

**Published:** 2026-01-12  
**Updated:** 2026-01-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Although the original EPR paradox was formulated in terms of position and momentum, most studies of these phenomena have focused on measurement scenarios with only a discrete number of possible measurement outcomes. Here, we present a framework for studying non-locality that is agnostic to the dimension of the physical systems involved, allowing us to probe purely continuous-variable, discrete-var...
