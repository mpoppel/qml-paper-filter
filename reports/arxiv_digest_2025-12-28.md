### [3D cavity-based graphene superconducting quantum circuits in two-qubit architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21213v1)
**Authors:** Kuei-Lin Chiu, Avishma J. Lasrado, Cheng-Han Lo et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall  

**Abstract:** We construct a series of graphene-based superconducting quantum circuits and integrate them into 3D cavities. For a single-qubit device, we demonstrate flux-tunable qubit transition, with a measured $T_1$ $\approx$ 48 ns and a lower bound estimate of $T_2^\ast$ $\approx$ 17.63 ns. By coupling the device to cavities with different resonant frequencies, we access multiple qubit-cavity coupling regim...

### [All-optical control and multiplexed readout of multiple superconducting qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21199v1)
**Authors:** Xiaoxuan Pan, Chuanlong Ma, Jia-Qi Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Superconducting quantum circuits operate at millikelvin temperatures, typically requiring independent microwave cables for each qubit for connecting room-temperature control and readout electronics. However, scaling to large-scale processors hosting hundreds of qubits faces a severe input/output (I/O) bottleneck, as the dense cable arrays impose prohibitive constraints on physical footprint, therm...

### [Random dilation superchannel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21260v1)
**Authors:** Satoshi Yoshida, Ryotaro Niwa, Mio Murao  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a quantum circuit that implements the random dilation superchannel, transforming parallel queries of an unknown quantum channel into parallel queries of a randomly chosen dilation isometry of the input channel. This is a natural generalization of a random purification channel, that transforms copies of an unknown mixed state to copies of a randomly chosen purification state. Our constru...

### [Interaction-Resilient Scalable Fluxonium Architecture with All-Microwave Gates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21189v1)
**Authors:** Andrei A. Kugut, Grigoriy S. Mazhorin, Ilya A. Simakov  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Fluxonium qubits demonstrate exceptional potential for quantum processing; yet, realizing scalable architectures using them remains challenging. We propose a fluxonium-based square-grid design with fast $\sim63$~ns controlled-Z (CZ) gates, achieving coherent errors below $10^{-4}$, activated via microwave-driven transmon couplers. A central difficulty in such large-scale systems with all-microwave...

### [Analytic and Variational Stability of Deep Learning Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21208v1)
**Authors:** Ronald Katende  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.DS, math.OC  

**Abstract:** We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theor...

### [Optimizing Decoding Paths in Masked Diffusion Models by Quantifying Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21336v1)
**Authors:** Ziyu Chen, Xinbei Jiang, Peng Sun et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) offer flexible, non-autoregressive generation, but this freedom introduces a challenge: final output quality is highly sensitive to the decoding order. We are the first to formalize this issue, attributing the variability in output quality to the cumulative predictive uncertainty along a generative path. To quantify this uncertainty, we introduce Denoising Entropy, a...

### [Autonomous Uncertainty Quantification for Computational Point-of-care Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21335v1)
**Authors:** Artem Goncharov, Rajesh Ghosh, Hyou-Arm Joung et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** physics.med-ph, cs.LG, physics.app-ph, physics.bio-ph  

**Abstract:** Computational point-of-care (POC) sensors enable rapid, low-cost, and accessible diagnostics in emergency, remote and resource-limited areas that lack access to centralized medical facilities. These systems can utilize neural network-based algorithms to accurately infer a diagnosis from the signals generated by rapid diagnostic tests or sensors. However, neural network-based diagnostic models are ...

### [C2LLM Technical Report: A New Frontier in Code Retrieval via Adaptive Cross-Attention Pooling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21332v1)
**Authors:** Jin Qin, Zihan Liao, Ziyin Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We present C2LLM - Contrastive Code Large Language Models, a family of code embedding models in both 0.5B and 7B sizes. Building upon Qwen-2.5-Coder backbones, C2LLM adopts a Pooling by Multihead Attention (PMA) module for generating sequence embedding from token embeddings, effectively 1) utilizing the LLM's causal representations acquired during pretraining, while also 2) being able to aggregate...

### [Measuring all the noises of LLM Evals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21326v1)
**Authors:** Sida Wang  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Separating signal from noise is central to experimental science. Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following th...

### [Parallel Token Prediction for Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21323v1)
**Authors:** Felix Draxler, Justus Will, Farrin Marouf Sofian et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We propose Parallel Token Prediction (PTP), a universal framework for parallel sequence generation in language models. PTP jointly predicts multiple dependent tokens in a single transformer call by incorporating the sampling procedure into the model. This reduces the latency bottleneck of autoregressive decoding, and avoids the restrictive independence assumptions common in existing multi-token pr...

### [Variationally correct operator learning: Reduced basis neural operator with a posteriori error estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21319v1)
**Authors:** Yuan Qiu, Wolfgang Dahmen, Peng Chen  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Minimizing PDE-residual losses is a common strategy to promote physical consistency in neural operators. However, standard formulations often lack variational correctness, meaning that small residuals do not guarantee small solution errors due to the use of non-compliant norms or ad hoc penalty terms for boundary conditions. This work develops a variationally correct operator learning framework by...

**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** econ.GN, cs.AI, cs.HC  

**Abstract:** This paper derives `Scaling Laws for Economic Impacts' -- empirical relationships between the training compute of Large Language Models (LLMs) and professional productivity. In a preregistered experiment, over 500 consultants, data analysts, and managers completed professional tasks using one of 13 LLMs. We find that each year of AI model progress reduced task time by 8%, with 56% of gains driven ...

### [Does the Data Processing Inequality Reflect Practice? On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21315v1)
**Authors:** Roy Turgeman, Tom Tirer  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, ...

**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.str-el, hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate the distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (entanglement spectrum) after a global quantum quench. We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined...

### [Learning to Solve PDEs on Neural Shape Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21311v1)
**Authors:** Lilian Welschinger, Yilin Liu, Zican Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) on shapes underpins many shape analysis and engineering tasks; yet, prevailing PDE solvers operate on polygonal/triangle meshes while modern 3D assets increasingly live as neural representations. This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual tra...

### [Optimizing Quantum State Transformation Under Locality Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21310v1)
**Authors:** Sasan Sarbishegi, Maryam Sadat Mirkamali  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In this paper, we present a general numerical framework for both deterministic and probabilistic quantum state transformations, under locality constraints. For a given arbitrary bipartite initial state and a desired bipartite target state, we construct an optimized local quantum channel that transforms the initial state into the target state with high fidelity. To achieve this goal, local quantum ...

### [A Note on Publicly Verifiable Quantum Money with Low Quantum Computational Resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21304v1)
**Authors:** Fabrizio Genovese, Lev Stambler  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** In this work we present a publicly verifiable quantum money protocol which assumes close to no quantum computational capabilities. We rely on one-time memories which in turn can be built from quantum conjugate coding and hardware-based assumptions. Specifically, our scheme allows for a limited number of verifications and also allows for quantum tokens for digital signatures. Double spending is pre...

**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Model merging has emerged as a lightweight alternative to joint multi-task learning (MTL), yet the generalization properties of merged models remain largely unexplored. Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributio...

### [Quantum computation of mass gap in an asymptotically free theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21282v1)
**Authors:** Paulo F. Bedaque, Edison M. Murairi, Gautam Rupak et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat, nucl-th  

**Abstract:** In relativistic field theories, the mass spectrum is given by the difference between the energy of the vacuum and the excited states. Near the continuum limit, the cancellation between these two values leads to loss of precision. We propose a method to extract the mass gap directly using quantum computers and apply it to a particular version of the nonlinear $σ$-model with the correct continuum li...

### [Hamilton-Jacobi as model reduction, extension to Newtonian particle mechanics, and a wave mechanical curiosity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21281v1)
**Authors:** Amit Acharya  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** math-ph, physics.class-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics is approached as a model reduction of conservative particle mechanics where the velocity degrees-of-freedom are eliminated. This viewpoint allows an extension of the association of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation from conservative systems to general Newtonian particle systems involving non-conservative forces, including dissipative ones. A geometric...

### [Characterizing quantum synchronization in the van der Pol oscillator via tomogram and photon correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21272v1)
**Authors:** Kingshuk Adhikary, K. M. Athira, M. Rohith  
**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We access the quantum synchronization (QS) in the steady state of a driven quantum van der Pol oscillator (vdPo) using two distinct figures of merit: (i) the nonclassical area $δ$ and (ii) the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(0)$, which are both viable in experimental architectures. The nonclassical area quantifier rooted in homodyne tomography, allows us to assess the nonclassical natur...

**Abstract:** We report the results of an experimental study of an analog of the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) effect achieved with the hydrodynamic pilot-wave system. A walking droplet is confined to an annular cavity that encircles a shielded vortex, but lies outside its range of direct influence. While there is no vortex-induced flow in the immediate vicinity of the droplets, the vortex modifies the droplet's spatially...

**Published:** 2025-12-24  
**Updated:** 2025-12-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We define and study the properties of ``squeezed quantum multiplets''. Ordinary multiplets are sets of $D$-orthonormal quantum states formed by superpositions of states squeezed along $D$ equally spaced directions in quadrature space. More generally, we also discuss superpositions of ``higher-order squeezed states'', including tri-squeezed and quad-squeezed states. All these states involve superpo...

**Abstract:** In micro- and nanoscale optomechanical systems, radiation pressure interactions are often complemented or impeded by photothermal forces arising from thermal strain induced by optical heating. We show that the sign and magnitude of the photothermal force can be engineered through deterministic nanoscale structural design, by considering the overlap of temperature and modal strain profiles. We demo...
