### [Illustration of Barren Plateaus in Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16558v1)
**Authors:** Gerhard Stenzel, Tobias Rohe, Michael Kölle et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global o...

### [Beyond the Classical Ceiling: Multi-Layer Fully-Connected Variational Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16623v1)
**Authors:** Howard Su, Chen-Yu Liu, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Standard Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) struggle to scale to high-dimensional data due to the ``curse of dimensionality,'' which manifests as exponential simulation costs ($\mathcal{O}(2^d)$) and untrainable Barren Plateaus. Existing solutions often bypass this by relying on classical neural networks for feature compression, obscuring the true quantum capability. In this work, we propose the ...

### [Factorization Machine with Quadratic-Optimization Annealing for RNA Inverse Folding and Evaluation of Binary-Integer Encoding and Nucleotide Assignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16643v1)
**Authors:** Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorizati...

### [Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Quantum State Preparation: A Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16523v1)
**Authors:** Gerhard Stenzel, Isabella Debelic, Michael Kölle et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first pr...

### [Causal and Compositional Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16612v1)
**Authors:** Robin Lorenz, Sean Tull  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LO, cs.AI, math.CT, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Abstracting from a low level to a more explanatory high level of description, and ideally while preserving causal structure, is fundamental to scientific practice, to causal inference problems, and to robust, efficient and interpretable AI. We present a general account of abstractions between low and high level models as natural transformations, focusing on the case of causal models. This provides...

### [Quantum Cellular Automata: The Group, the Space, and the Spectrum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16572v1)
**Authors:** Mattie Ji, Bowen Yang  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** math.AT, math-ph, math.OA, math.RA, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Over an arbitrary commutative ring $R$, we develop a theory of quantum cellular automata. We then use algebraic K-theory to construct a space $\mathbf{Q}(X)$ of quantum cellular automata (QCA) on a given metric space $X$. In most cases of interest, $π_0 \mathbf{Q}(X)$ classifies QCA up to quantum circuits and stabilization. Notably, the QCA spaces are related by homotopy equivalences $\mathbf{Q}(*...

### [MerLean: An Agentic Framework for Autoformalization in Quantum Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16554v1)
**Authors:** Yuanjie Ren, Jinzheng Li, Yidi Qi  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LO, cs.AI, cs.ET, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce MerLean, a fully automated agentic framework for autoformalization in quantum computation. MerLean extracts mathematical statements from \LaTeX{} source files, formalizes them into verified Lean~4 code built on Mathlib, and translates the result back into human-readable \LaTeX{} for semantic review. We evaluate MerLean on three theoretical quantum computing papers producing 2,050 Lean...

### [Knowledge-Embedded Latent Projection for Robust Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16709v1)
**Authors:** Weijing Tang, Ming Yuan, Zongqi Xia et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.ST, stat.ME  

**Abstract:** Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes ar...

**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.AI, cs.MA  

**Abstract:** LLM-based agents are increasingly being deployed in contexts requiring complex authorization policies: customer service protocols, approval workflows, data access restrictions, and regulatory compliance. Embedding these policies in prompts provides no enforcement guarantees. We present PCAS, a Policy Compiler for Agentic Systems that provides deterministic policy enforcement.   Enforcing such poli...

### [Measuring Mid-2025 LLM-Assistance on Novice Performance in Biology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16703v1)
**Authors:** Shen Zhou Hong, Alex Kleinman, Alyssa Mathiowetz et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.CY, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) perform strongly on biological benchmarks, raising concerns that they may help novice actors acquire dual-use laboratory skills. Yet, whether this translates to improved human performance in the physical laboratory remains unclear. To address this, we conducted a pre-registered, investigator-blinded, randomized controlled trial (June-August 2025; n = 153) evaluating wh...

### [Calibrate-Then-Act: Cost-Aware Exploration in LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16699v1)
**Authors:** Wenxuan Ding, Nicholas Tomlin, Greg Durrett  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** LLMs are increasingly being used for complex problems which are not necessarily resolved in a single response, but require interacting with an environment to acquire information. In these scenarios, LLMs must reason about inherent cost-uncertainty tradeoffs in when to stop exploring and commit to an answer. For instance, on a programming task, an LLM should test a generated code snippet if it is u...

### [Causality is Key for Interpretability Claims to Generalise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16698v1)
**Authors:** Shruti Joshi, Aaron Mueller, David Klindt et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed ...

### [Protecting the Undeleted in Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16697v1)
**Authors:** Aloni Cohen, Refael Kohen, Kobbi Nissim et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DS  

**Abstract:** Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstructio...

**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** q-bio.GN, cs.LG, q-bio.QM  

**Abstract:** Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) perf...

### [Are Object-Centric Representations Better At Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16689v1)
**Authors:** Ferdinand Kapl, Amir Mohammad Karimi Mamaghan, Maximilian Seitzer et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question...

**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.CC, cs.DS, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** In this work, we study the hardness of approximation of the fair $k$-center problem. Here the data points are partitioned into groups and the task is to choose a prescribed number of data points from each group, called centers, while minimizing the maximum distance from any point to its closest center. Although a polynomial-time $3$-approximation is known for this problem in general metrics, it ha...

**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-sc...

### [Neighborhood Stability as a Measure of Nearest Neighbor Searchability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16673v1)
**Authors:** Thomas Vecchiato, Sebastian Bruch  
**Published:** 2026-02-18  
**Updated:** 2026-02-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.IR  

**Abstract:** Clustering-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) organizes a set of points into partitions, and searches only a few of them to find the nearest neighbors of a query. Despite its popularity, there are virtually no analytical tools to determine the suitability of clustering-based ANNS for a given dataset -- what we call "searchability." To address that gap, we present two measures for fla...

**Abstract:** AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave ...

**Abstract:** We study the mean-field dynamics of a system of $N$ interacting bosons starting from an initially condensated state. For a broad class of mean-field Hamiltonians, including models with arbitrary bounded interactions and models with unbounded interaction potentials, we prove that the probability of having $n$ particles outside the condensate decays exponentially in $n$ for any finite evolution time...

**Abstract:** The solar dynamo relies on the regeneration of the poloidal magnetic field through processes strongly modulated by nonlinear feedbacks such as tilt quenching (TQ) and latitude quenching (LQ). These mechanisms play a decisive role in regulating the buildup of the Sun's polar field and, in turn, the amplitude of future solar cycles. In this work, we employ Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINN) to ...

**Abstract:** We consider the amplification of bosonic interactions through parametric control that implements squeezing along orthogonal quadratures. We show that bosonic interactions described by certain classes of quadratic and quartic Hamiltonians can be enhanced in this way while simultaneously overcoming noise and decoherence. In general, the amplification method enhances both desired and undesired intera...

**Abstract:** Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture ...

**Abstract:** We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on ...

### [On the Coupled Cluster Doubles Truncation Variety of Four Electrons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16580v1)
**Authors:** Fabian M. Faulstich, Vincenzo Galgano, Elke Neuhaus et al.

**Abstract:** We extend recent algebro-geometric results for coupled cluster theory of quantum many-body systems to the truncation varieties arising from the doubles approximation (CCD), focusing on the first genuinely nonlinear doubles regime of four electrons. Since this doubles truncation variety does not coincide with previously studied varieties, we initiate a systematic investigation of its basic algebro-...

**Abstract:** Measurements of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) neutrino mixing parameters have entered a precision era, enabling increasingly stringent tests of neutrino oscillations. Within the framework of quantum estimation theory, we investigate whether flavor measurements, the only observables currently accessible experimentally, are optimal for extracting the oscillation parameters. We compute t...
