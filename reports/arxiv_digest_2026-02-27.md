**Authors:** Haohui Jia, Zheng Chen, Lingwei Zhu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs...

### [Gaussian mode coupling of spectrally broadband photons from bulk spontaneous parametric down-conversion: A spatial-spectral mode analysis of fiber coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23238v1)
**Authors:** Carlos Sevilla-Gutiérrez, Varun Raj Kaipalath, Fabian Steinlechner  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Photon sources based on spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) are central to experimental quantum optics and quantum technologies. Their performance is commonly quantified by three metrics: pair-collection probability, heralding efficiency, and spectral purity. In bulk-crystal SPDC, these metrics are known to be mutually constrained, yet the physical origin of the resulting trade-offs is o...

### [Efficient evaluation of fundamental sensitivity limits and full counting statistics for continuously monitored Gaussian quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23304v1)
**Authors:** Francesco Albarelli, Marco G. Genoni  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Generalized master equations (GMEs) -- time-local but generally neither trace-preserving nor Hermiticity-preserving -- are convenient tools to compute properties of the environment of an open or continuously monitored quantum system. A two-sided master equation yields the fidelity and quantum Fisher information (QFI) of environment states, thereby setting fundamental limits for hypothesis testing ...

### [Dequantization Barriers for Guided Stoquastic Hamiltonians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23183v1)
**Authors:** Yassine Hamoudi, Yvan Le Borgne, Shrinidhi Teganahally Sridhara  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC, cs.DS  

**Abstract:** We construct a probability distribution, induced by the Perron--Frobenius eigenvector of an exponentially large graph, which cannot be efficiently sampled by any classical algorithm, even when provided with the best-possible warm-start distribution. In the quantum setting, this problem can be viewed as preparing the ground state of a stoquastic Hamiltonian given a guiding state as input, and is kn...

**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** Excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) have been extensively studied in two-level models, but their characterization remains challenging in systems displaying mixed regular and chaotic dynamics. In this work, we investigate ESQPTs within the three-level Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, where an enlarged Hilbert space and multiple separatrices give rise to rich spectral structures strongly inf...

### [SettleFL: Trustless and Scalable Reward Settlement Protocol for Federated Learning on Permissionless Blockchains (Extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23167v1)
**Authors:** Shuang Liang, Yang Hua, Linshan Jiang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** In open Federated Learning (FL) environments where no central authority exists, ensuring collaboration fairness relies on decentralized reward settlement, yet the prohibitive cost of permissionless blockchains directly clashes with the high-frequency, iterative nature of model training. Existing solutions either compromise decentralization or suffer from scalability bottlenecks due to linear on-ch...

**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, gr-qc  

**Abstract:** Operational probes of the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity in the Newtonian regime -- via mass-energy equivalence in clocks or spatial superpositions in interferometers -- share a common description in terms of an effective qubit-qubit Ising coupling. Here we generalize both paradigms to interacting $(N+1)$-level effective qudits made of atomic ensembles with particle num...

**Authors:** Eric Eaton, Surbhi Goel, Marcel Hussing et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Numerous lines of aim to control $\textit{model disagreement}$ -- the extent to which two machine learning models disagree in their predictions. We adopt a simple and standard notion of model disagreement in real-valued prediction problems, namely the expected squared difference in predictions between two models trained on independent samples, without any coordination of the training processes. We...

### [SeeThrough3D: Occlusion Aware 3D Control in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23359v1)
**Authors:** Vaibhav Agrawal, Rishubh Parihar, Pradhaan Bhat et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout cond...

### [A Dataset is Worth 1 MB](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23358v1)
**Authors:** Elad Kimchi Shoshani, Leeyam Gabay, Yedid Hoshen  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, cu...

**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that neural networks trained on different modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of the world. Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful...

### [FlashOptim: Optimizers for Memory Efficient Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23349v1)
**Authors:** Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz, Abhay Gupta, Chris Renard et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of acceler...

### [Mean Estimation from Coarse Data: Characterizations and Efficient Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23341v1)
**Authors:** Alkis Kalavasis, Anay Mehrotra, Manolis Zampetakis et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DS, math.ST, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covaria...

**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The extreme sensitivity of chaotic systems to external perturbations makes them natural candidates for sensing applications. We propose a single-shot echo-based protocol for estimating small rotations about an unknown axis that leverages random symmetric probe states prepared via chaotic dynamics. In contrast to previous protocols for this axis-agnostic rotation sensing problem that depend on diff...

### [Polarization-selective quantum cooperative response in dual-species atom arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23237v1)
**Authors:** Huan Wang, Shangguo Zhu, Yun Long et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, physics.atom-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Atom arrays have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum light-matter interfaces, yet single-species arrays are constrained by in-plane symmetry, restricting polarization control. Here we investigate the cooperative optical response of dual-species subwavelength atom arrays, in which intrinsic polarizability difference breaks in-plane symmetry. By engineering the lattice spacing and detunings, ...

**Abstract:** Quantum theory departs from classical physics in its treatment of correlations, most prominently through the phenomena of contextuality and nonlocality. Once regarded primarily as foundational curiosities, these effects are now understood as key operational resources for quantum computation, communication, and simulation. Although traditionally investigated in distinct settings, recent theoretical...

### [Scaling and Luescher Term in a non-Abelian (2+1)d SU$(2)$ Quantum Link Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23213v1)
**Authors:** Paul Ludwig, Timo Jakobs, Carsten Urbach  
**Published:** 2026-02-26  
**Updated:** 2026-02-26  
**Categories:** hep-lat, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate a non-Abelian SU$(2)$ quantum link model in 2+1 dimensions on a hexagonal lattice using tensor network methods. We determine the static quark potential for a wide range of bare coupling values and find that the theory is confining. We also probe the existence of a Luescher term and find a clear signal, however, the value of the dimensionless constant $γ$ strongly deviates from the e...
