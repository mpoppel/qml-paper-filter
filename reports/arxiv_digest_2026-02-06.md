### [Modeling integrated frequency shifters and beam splitters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06003v1)
**Authors:** Manuel H. Muñoz-Arias, Kevin J. Randles, Nils T. Otterstrom et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Photonic quantum computing is a strong contender in the race to fault-tolerance. Recent proposals using qubits encoded in frequency modes promise a large reduction in hardware footprint, and have garnered much attention. In this encoding, linear optics, i.e., beam splitters and phase shifters, is necessarily not energy-conserving, and is costly to implement. In this work, we present designs of fre...

### [Improving Ground State Accuracy of Variational Quantum Eigensolvers with Soft-coded Orthogonal Subspace Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05980v1)
**Authors:** Giuseppe Clemente, Marco Intini  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat  

**Abstract:** We propose a new approach to improve the accuracy of ground state estimates in Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithms by employing subspace representations with soft-coded orthogonality constraints. As in other subspace-based VQE methods, such as the Subspace-Search VQE (SSVQE) and Multistate Contracted VQE (MCVQE), once the parameters are optimized to maximize the subspace overlap with ...

### [Improved Rodeo Algorithm Performance for Spectral Functions and State Preparation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05978v1)
**Authors:** Matthew Patkowski, Onat Ayyildiz, Katherine Hunt et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Rodeo Algorithm is a quantum computing method for computing the energy spectrum of a Hamiltonian and preparing its energy eigenstates. We discuss how to improve the performance of the rodeo algorithm for each of these two applications. In particular, we demonstrate that using a geometric series of time samples offers a near-optimal optimization space for a given total runtime by studying the R...

### [Breaking Symmetry Bottlenecks in GNN Readouts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05950v1)
**Authors:** Mouad Talhi, Arne Wolf, Anthea Monod  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used for learning on structured data, yet their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs is fundamentally limited. These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant read...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** hep-lat, hep-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present the first quantum-simulation study of bound and resonant doubly-bottom tetraquark states within a QCD-inspired chiral quark model. An effective four-quark Hamiltonian is mapped onto a 16-qubit register, encoding color, spin, and spatial degrees of freedom, and incorporating both meson-meson and diquark-antidiquark configurations with complete color bases. Using a variational quantum eig...

### [Quantum Error Mitigation at the pre-processing stage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05916v1)
**Authors:** Juan F. Martin, Giuseppe Cocco, Javier Fonollosa  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers remains a challenging endeavor, forcing state-of-the-art quantum hardware to rely heavily on noise mitigation techniques. Standard quantum error mitigation is typically based on post-processing strategies. In contrast, the present work explores a pre-processing approach, in which the effects of noise are mitigated before performing a measurement ...

### [Dissipative Dicke Time Quasicrystals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05994v1)
**Authors:** Sk Anisur, Sayan Choudhury  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** We investigate the emergence of time quasicrystals (TQCs) in the open Dicke model, subjected to a quasi-periodic Fibonacci drive. TQCs are characterized by a robust sub-harmonic quasi-periodic response that is qualitatively distinct from the external drive. By directly analyzing the dynamics of the system in the thermodynamic limit, we establish the existence of TQC order in this system for a wide...

**Authors:** Junlan Jin, Yue Shi, Youssef Aziz Alaoui et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** physics.atom-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We report on the realization of a $^{133}$Cs optical tweezer array in a cryogenic blackbody radiation (BBR) environment. By enclosing the array within a 4K radiation shield, we measure long Rydberg lifetimes, up to $406 (36)\,μ$s for the $55 P_{3/2}$ Rydberg state, a factor of 3.3(3) longer than the room-temperature value. We employ single-photon coupling for coherent manipulation of the ground-Ry...

### [Shared LoRA Subspaces for almost Strict Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06043v1)
**Authors:** Prakhar Kaushik, Ankit Vaidya, Shravan Chaudhari et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Adapting large pretrained models to new tasks efficiently and continually is crucial for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to catastrophic forgetting and the high cost of retraining. While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on d...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** The Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse (PInv) serves as the fundamental solution for linear systems. In this paper, we propose a natural generalization of PInv to the nonlinear regime in general and to neural networks in particular. We introduce Surjective Pseudo-invertible Neural Networks (SPNN), a class of architectures explicitly designed to admit a tractable non-linear PInv. The proposed non-linear ...

**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Multi-agent systems built from prompted large language models can improve multi-round reasoning, yet most existing pipelines rely on fixed, trajectory-wide communication patterns that are poorly matched to the stage-dependent needs of iterative problem solving. We introduce DyTopo, a manager-guided multi-agent framework that reconstructs a sparse directed communication graph at each round. Conditi...

### [Can vision language models learn intuitive physics from interaction?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06033v1)
**Authors:** Luca M. Schulze Buschoff, Konstantinos Voudouris, Can Demircan et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision language models do not have good intuitions about the physical world. Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks. However, fine-tuned models do not appear to learn robust physical rules that can generalize to new contexts. Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an envi...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.MA, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enable expressive agent reasoning but are expensive to scale and poorly calibrated for timestep-aligned state-transition simulation, while classical agent-based models (ABMs) offer interpretability but struggle to integrate rich individual-level signals and non-stationary behaviors. We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviora...

### [AP-OOD: Attention Pooling for Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06031v1)
**Authors:** Claus Hofmann, Christian Huber, Bernhard Lehner et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, which maps high-dimensional data into a scalar OOD score, is critical for the reliable deployment of machine learning models. A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes b...

### [Curiosity is Knowledge: Self-Consistent Learning and No-Regret Optimization with Active Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06029v1)
**Authors:** Yingke Li, Anjali Parashar, Enlu Zhou et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Active inference (AIF) unifies exploration and exploitation by minimizing the Expected Free Energy (EFE), balancing epistemic value (information gain) and pragmatic value (task performance) through a curiosity coefficient. Yet it has been unclear when this balance yields both coherent learning and efficient decision-making: insufficient curiosity can drive myopic exploitation and prevent uncertain...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Memory is increasingly central to Large Language Model (LLM) agents operating beyond a single context window, yet most existing systems rely on offline, query-agnostic memory construction that can be inefficient and may discard query-critical information. Although runtime memory utilization is a natural alternative, prior work often incurs substantial overhead and offers limited explicit control o...

**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a powerful tool for evaluating school security measures in high-risk scenarios such as school shootings, offering experimental control and high behavioral fidelity. However, assessing new interventions in VR requires recruiting new participant cohorts for each condition, making large-scale or iterative evaluation difficult. These limitations are especially restr...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) exhibit persistent miscalibration, especially after instruction tuning and preference alignment. Modified training objectives can improve calibration, but retraining is expensive. Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized ...

### [Diffusion Model's Generalization Can Be Characterized by Inductive Biases toward a Data-Dependent Ridge Manifold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06021v1)
**Authors:** Ye He, Yitong Qiu, Molei Tao  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, math.NA, math.PR  

**Abstract:** When a diffusion model is not memorizing the training data set, how does it generalize exactly? A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the gener...

**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, q-bio.BM  

**Abstract:** How do protein structure prediction models fold proteins? We investigate this question by tracing how ESMFold folds a beta hairpin, a prevalent structural motif. Through counterfactual interventions on model latents, we identify two computational stages in the folding trunk. In the first stage, early blocks initialize pairwise biochemical signals: residue identities and associated biochemical feat...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, math.OC, math.ST, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Thompson sampling (TS) is widely used for stochastic multi-armed bandits, yet its inferential properties under adaptive data collection are subtle. Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \emph{optimism} as...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose "Diamond Maps", stochastic flow map ...

**Abstract:** Pre-training Large Language Models (LLMs) on web-scale datasets becomes fundamental for advancing general-purpose AI. In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing ...

### [Geographically-aware Transformer-based Traffic Forecasting for Urban Motorway Digital Twins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05983v1)
**Authors:** Krešimir Kušić, Vinny Cahill, Ivana Dusparic  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The operational effectiveness of digital-twin technology in motorway traffic management depends on the availability of a continuous flow of high-resolution real-time traffic data. To function as a proactive decision-making support layer within traffic management, a digital twin must also incorporate predicted traffic conditions in addition to real-time observations. Due to the spatio-temporal comp...

**Categories:** physics.optics, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) are promising to overcome the wavelength coverage and noise limitations in conventional optical amplifiers based on rare-earth doping and semiconductor gain. However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges ass...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We introduce Clifford Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (ClKAN), a flexible and efficient architecture for function approximation in arbitrary Clifford algebra spaces. We propose the use of Randomized Quasi Monte Carlo grid generation as a solution to the exponential scaling associated with higher dimensional algebras. Our ClKAN also introduces new batch normalization strategies to deal with variable doma...

### [Does Cosmology require Hermiticity in Quantum Mechanics?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05973v1)
**Authors:** Oem Trivedi, Alfredo Gurrola

**Categories:** astro-ph.CO, gr-qc, hep-ph, hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We explore the consequences of allowing non-Hermitian structures in quantum cosmology by extending the Wheeler DeWitt framework beyond strictly Hermitian dynamics. Using a controlled semiclassical reduction, we show how anti Hermitian contributions propagate into both early universe primordial fluctuations and late-time structure growth as effective damping or gain terms. Confronting this framewor...

### [One-Way Quantum Secure Direct Communication with Choice of Measurement Basis as the Secret](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05972v1)
**Authors:** Santiago Bustamante, Boris A. Rodríguez, Elizabeth Agudelo  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Motivated by the question of the distinguishability of ensembles described by the same compressed density operator, we propose a model for one-way quantum secure direct communication using finite ensembles of shared EPR pairs per bit and a public authenticated classical channel, where the local choice of one of two mutually-unbiased measurement bases is the secret bit. In this model, both the enco...

**Abstract:** Semantic representations can be framed as a structured, dynamic knowledge space through which humans navigate to retrieve and manipulate meaning. To investigate how humans traverse this geometry, we introduce a framework that represents concept production as navigation through embedding space. Using different transformer text embedding models, we construct participant-specific semantic trajectorie...

### [Inverse Depth Scaling From Most Layers Being Similar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05970v1)

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, math.DS, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Neural scaling laws relate loss to model size in large language models (LLMs), yet depth and width may contribute to performance differently, requiring more detailed studies. Here, we quantify how depth affects loss via analysis of LLMs and toy residual networks. We find loss scales inversely proportional to depth in LLMs, probably due to functionally similar layers reducing error through ensemble...

**Abstract:** Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders req...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Recent research shows that Preference Alignment (PA) objectives act as divergence estimators between aligned (chosen) and unaligned (rejected) response distributions. In this work, we extend this divergence-based perspective to general alignment settings, such as reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), where only environmental rewards are available. Within this unified framework, we...

### [On the Efimov Effect for Four Particles in Dimension Two](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05942v1)
**Authors:** Jonathan Rau, Marvin R. Schulz  
**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We prove that the Schrödinger operator describing four particles in two dimensions, interacting solely through short-range three-body forces, can possess infinitely many bound states. This holds under the assumption that each three-body subsystem has a virtual level at zero energy. Our result establishes an analog of the Efimov effect for such four-particle systems in two dimensions.

### ["It from Bit": The Hartle-Hawking state and quantum mechanics for de Sitter observers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05939v1)
**Authors:** Ying Zhao

**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** hep-th, gr-qc, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The one-state statement for closed universes has sparked considerable discussion. In this paper we examine its physical meaning in the context of the Hartle-Hawking state and de Sitter space. We argue that the one-state property of closed universes is fully compatible with the finite-dimensional quantum mechanics experienced by observers inside de Sitter space, and that this compatibility requires...

**Abstract:** Measurement plays a crucial role in a quantum system beyond just learning about the system state: it changes the post-measurement state and hence influences the subsequent time evolution; further, measurement can even create entanglement in the post-measurement conditional state. In this work, we study how careful choice of parameters for a typical measurement process on cold atoms systems -- phas...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We consider the transition between short-range entangled (SRE) and long-range ordered (and therefore long-range entangled) states of infinite quantum spin chains, which is induced by local measurements. Specifically, we assume that the initial state is in a non-trivial symmetry-protected topological phase with local symmetry group $\mathcal{G} = G \times H$, where $G$ is an Abelian subgroup. We sh...

**Published:** 2026-02-05  
**Updated:** 2026-02-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Random thermal states of many-body Hamiltonians underpin studies of thermalization, chaos, and quantum phase transitions, yet their generation remains costly when each Hamiltonian must be prepared individually. We introduce the thermal-drift channel, a measurement-based operation that implements a tunable nonunitary drift along a chosen Pauli term. Based on this channel, we present a measurement-c...
