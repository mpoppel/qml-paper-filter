**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.other  

**Abstract:** The potential of solid-state quantum emitters for applications critically depends on several key figures of merit. One of the most important is the quantum coherence of the emitted single photons, which can be compromised by fast dephasing and spectral diffusion. In hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), blue-emitting color centers (or B centers) are seen as favorable in this regard, in the light of prior...

### [A Unified Convergence Analysis for Semi-Decentralized Learning: Sampled-to-Sampled vs. Sampled-to-All Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11560v1)
**Authors:** Angelo Rodio, Giovanni Neglia, Zheng Chen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-14  
**Updated:** 2025-11-14  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DC  

**Abstract:** In semi-decentralized federated learning, devices primarily rely on device-to-device communication but occasionally interact with a central server. Periodically, a sampled subset of devices uploads their local models to the server, which computes an aggregate model. The server can then either (i) share this aggregate model only with the sampled clients (sampled-to-sampled, S2S) or (ii) broadcast i...

**Published:** 2025-11-14  
**Updated:** 2025-11-14  
**Categories:** cs.LG, eess.SY, math.DS  

**Abstract:** In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head''...

**Published:** 2025-11-14  
**Updated:** 2025-11-14  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall  

**Abstract:** Analogous to Coulomb blockade for electrons, photon blockade is a key quantum optical effect in which the presence of one photon prevents the transmission of subsequent ones through a nonlinear medium. Beyond its fundamental interest, photon and multi-photon blockade are actively studied as mechanisms for generating technologically-relevant quantum states of light. Although photon blockade typical...

**Abstract:** In this work, we estimate the intrinsic dimension (iD) of the Radio Galaxy Zoo (RGZ) dataset using a score-based diffusion model. We examine how the iD estimates vary as a function of Bayesian neural network (BNN) energy scores, which measure how similar the radio sources are to the MiraBest subset of the RGZ dataset. We find that out-of-distribution sources exhibit higher iD values, and that the ...
