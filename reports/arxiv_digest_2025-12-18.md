### [Prospects for quantum advantage in machine learning from the representability of functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15661v1)
**Authors:** Sergi Masot-Llima, Elies Gil-Fuster, Carlos Bravo-Prieto et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Demonstrating quantum advantage in machine learning tasks requires navigating a complex landscape of proposed models and algorithms. To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth a...

### [High-Dimensional Partial Least Squares: Spectral Analysis and Fundamental Limitations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15684v1)
**Authors:** Victor Léger, Florent Chatelain  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Partial Least Squares (PLS) is a widely used method for data integration, designed to extract latent components shared across paired high-dimensional datasets. Despite decades of practical success, a precise theoretical understanding of its behavior in high-dimensional regimes remains limited. In this paper, we study a data integration model in which two high-dimensional data matrices share a low-...

### [Spatia: Video Generation with Updatable Spatial Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15716v1)
**Authors:** Jinjing Zhao, Fangyun Wei, Zhening Liu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Existing video generation models struggle to maintain long-term spatial and temporal consistency due to the dense, high-dimensional nature of video signals. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatia, a spatial memory-aware video generation framework that explicitly preserves a 3D scene point cloud as persistent spatial memory. Spatia iteratively generates video clips conditioned on this spati...

### [Large Isolated Stripes on Short 18-leg $t$-$J$ Cylinders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15714v1)
**Authors:** Tizian Blatz, Sebastian Paeckel, Ulrich Schollwöck et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Spin-charge stripes belong to the most prominent low-temperature orders besides superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. This phase is particularly challenging to study numerically due to finite-size effects. By investigating the formation of long, isolated stripes, we offer a perspective complementary to typical finite-doping phase diagrams. We use the density-matrix renormalization...

### [Predictive Concept Decoders: Training Scalable End-to-End Interpretability Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15712v1)
**Authors:** Vincent Huang, Dami Choi, Daniel D. Johnson et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Interpreting the internal activations of neural networks can produce more faithful explanations of their behavior, but is difficult due to the complex structure of activation space. Existing approaches to scalable interpretability use hand-designed agents that make and test hypotheses about how internal activations relate to external behavior. We propose to instead turn this task into an end-to-en...

### [Learning Model Parameter Dynamics in a Combination Therapy for Bladder Cancer from Sparse Biological Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15706v1)
**Authors:** Kayode Olumoyin, Lamees El Naqa, Katarzyna Rejniak  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, q-bio.CB  

**Abstract:** In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to...

### [Dynamic Rebatching for Efficient Early-Exit Inference with DREX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15705v1)
**Authors:** Xuting Liu, Daniel Alexander, Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.DC, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Early-Exit (EE) is a Large Language Model (LLM) architecture that accelerates inference by allowing easier tokens to be generated using only a subset of the model's layers. However, traditional batching frameworks are ill-suited for EE LLMs, as not all requests in a batch may be ready to exit at the same time. Existing solutions either force a uniform decision on the batch, which overlooks EE oppo...

### [An introduction to nonlinear fiber optics and optical analogues to gravitational phenomena](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15695v1)
**Authors:** Dimitrios Kranas, Andleeb Zahra, Friedrich König  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** gr-qc, physics.optics, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The optical fiber is a revolutionary technology of the past century. It enables us to manipulate single modes in nonlinear interactions with precision at the quantum level without involved setups. This setting is useful in the field of analogue gravity (AG), where gravitational phenomena are investigated in accessible analogue lab setups. These lecture notes provide an account of this AG framework...

### [mimic-video: Video-Action Models for Generalizable Robot Control Beyond VLAs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15692v1)
**Authors:** Jonas Pai, Liam Achenbach, Victoriano Montesinos et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Prevailing Vision-Language-Action Models (VLAs) for robotic manipulation are built upon vision-language backbones pretrained on large-scale, but disconnected static web data. As a result, despite improved semantic generalization, the policy must implicitly infer complex physical dynamics and temporal dependencies solely from robot trajectories. This reliance creates an unsustainable data burden, n...

**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.IT, eess.SP, eess.SY  

**Abstract:** Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple ...

### [A random purification channel for arbitrary symmetries with applications to fermions and bosons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15690v1)
**Authors:** Michael Walter, Freek Witteveen  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** The random purification channel maps n copies of any mixed quantum state to n copies of a random purification of the state. We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise pro...

### [Error mitigation for logical circuits using decoder confidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15689v1)
**Authors:** Maria Dincă, Tim Chan, Simon C. Benjamin  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate t...

### [Can LLMs Guide Their Own Exploration? Gradient-Guided Reinforcement Learning for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15687v1)
**Authors:** Zhenwen Liang, Sidi Lu, Wenhao Yu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimiz...

### [Combinatorial structures in quantum correlation: A new perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15686v1)
**Authors:** Rohit kumar, Satyabrata Adhikari  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Graph-theoretic structures play a central role in the description and analysis of quantum systems. In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_α$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different...

### [Stylized Synthetic Augmentation further improves Corruption Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15675v1)
**Authors:** Georg Siedel, Rojan Regmi, Abhirami Anand et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We condu...

### [All Entangled States are Nonlocal and Self-Testable in the Broadcast Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15656v1)
**Authors:** Pavel Sekatski, Jef Pauwels  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Entanglement and Bell nonlocality are known to be inequivalent: there exist entangled states that admit a local hidden-variable model for all local measurements. Here we show that this gap disappears in a minimal broadcast extension of the Bell scenario. Assuming only the validity of quantum theory, we prove that for every entangled state $ρ_{AB}$ there exist local broadcasting maps and local meas...

### [Characterization of Generalized Coherent States through Intensity-Field Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15655v1)
**Authors:** Ignacio Salinas Valdivieso, Victor Gondret, Gerd Hartmann S. et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-17  
**Updated:** 2025-12-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Non-Gaussian quantum states of light are essential resources for quantum information processing and precision metrology. Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states rem...
