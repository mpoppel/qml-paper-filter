### [Real-Time Iteration Scheme for Dynamical Mean-Field Theory: A Framework for Near-Term Quantum Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19896v1)
**Authors:** Chakradhar Rangi, Aadi Singh, Ka-Ming Tam  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a time-domain iteration scheme for solving the Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) self-consistent equations using retarded Green's functions in real time. Unlike conventional DMFT approaches that operate in imaginary time or frequency space, our scheme operates directly with real-time quantities. This makes it particularly suitable for near-term quantum computing hardware with limited H...

### [SONIC: Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19884v1)
**Authors:** Gijs Joppe Moens, Regina Beets-Tan, Eduardo H. P. Pooch  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these li...

### [Quantum Circuit Pre-Synthesis: Learning Local Edits to Reduce $T$-count](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19738v1)
**Authors:** Daniele Lizzio Bosco, Lukasz Cincio, Giuseppe Serra et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Compiling quantum circuits into Clifford+$T$ gates is a central task for fault-tolerant quantum computing using stabilizer codes. In the near term, $T$ gates will dominate the cost of fault tolerant implementations, and any reduction in the number of such expensive gates could mean the difference between being able to run a circuit or not. While exact synthesis is exponentially hard in the number ...

### [Post-LayerNorm Is Back: Stable, ExpressivE, and Deep](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19895v1)
**Authors:** Chen Chen, Lai Wei  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM) scaling is hitting a wall. Widening models yields diminishing returns, and extending context length does not improve fundamental expressivity. In contrast, depth scaling offers theoretically superior expressivity, yet current Transformer architectures struggle to train reliably at extreme depths. We revisit the Post-LayerNorm (Post-LN) formulation, whose instability at s...

### [Distinguishing synthetic unravelings on quantum computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19889v1)
**Authors:** Eloy Piñol, Piotr Sierant, Dustin Keys et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Distinct monitoring or intervention schemes can produce different conditioned stochastic quantum trajectories while sharing the same unconditional (ensemble-averaged) dynamics. This is the essence of unravelings of a given Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation: any trajectory-ensemble average of a function that is linear in the conditional state is completely determined by t...

### [Simple broadband signal detection at the fundamental limit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19816v1)
**Authors:** Anthony M. Polloreno, Graeme Smith  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.atom-ph  

**Abstract:** Broadband detection of a weak oscillatory field with unknown carrier frequency underlies magnetometry, axion searches and gravitational-wave sensing. We show that the Grover-like integration-time lower bound for this task is a geometric corollary an upper bound on the integrated quantum Fisher information, a metrological constraint. We further give an all-analog multi-resonant protocol based on a ...

### [Resolving Gauge Ambiguities of the Berry Connection in Non-Hermitian Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19777v1)
**Authors:** Ievgen I. Arkhipov  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.quant-gas  

**Abstract:** Non-Hermitian systems display spectral and topological phenomena absent in Hermitian physics; yet, their geometric characterization can be hindered by an intrinsic ambiguity rooted in the eigenspace of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, which becomes especially pronounced in the pure quantum regime. Because left and right eigenvectors are not related by conjugation, their norms are not fixed, giving rise...

### [Spectral Codes: A Geometric Formalism for Quantum Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19765v1)
**Authors:** Satoshi Kanno, Yoshi-aki Shimada  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-th  

**Abstract:** We present a new geometric perspective on quantum error correction based on spectral triples in noncommutative geometry. In this approach, quantum error correcting codes are reformulated as low energy spectral projections of Dirac type operators that separate global logical degrees of freedom from local, correctable errors. Locality, code distance, and the Knill Laflamme condition acquire a unifie...

### [Inter-branch message transfer on superconducting quantum processors: a multi-architecture benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19762v1)
**Authors:** Cameron V. Cogburn  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We treat inter-branch message transfer in a Wigner's-friend circuit as a practical benchmark for near-term superconducting quantum processors. Implementing Violaris' unitary message-transfer primitive, we compare performance across IBM Eagle, Nighthawk, and Heron (r2/r3) processors for message sizes up to $n=32$, without error mitigation. We study three message families -- sparse (one-hot), half-w...

**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SF...

**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** stat.ME, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The first law of geography is a cornerstone of spatial analysis, emphasizing that nearby and related locations tend to be more similar, however, defining what constitutes "near" and "related" remains challenging, as different phenomena exhibit distinct spatial patterns. Traditional local regression models, such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale GWR (MGWR), quantify spatial...

### [AI Cap-and-Trade: Efficiency Incentives for Accessibility and Sustainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19886v1)
**Authors:** Marco Bornstein, Amrit Singh Bedi  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** econ.GN, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.GT  

**Abstract:** The race for artificial intelligence (AI) dominance often prioritizes scale over efficiency. Hyper-scaling is the common industry approach: larger models, more data, and as many computational resources as possible. Using more resources is a simpler path to improved AI performance. Thus, efficiency has been de-emphasized. Consequently, the need for costly computational resources has marginalized ac...

### [Calibration without Ground Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19862v1)
**Authors:** Yuqing Kong, Mingyu Song, Yizhou Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.GT  

**Abstract:** Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improv...

**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Graph states provide a powerful framework for describing multipartite entanglement in quantum information science. In their standard formulation, graph states are generated by controlled-$Z$ interactions and naturally encode symmetric exchange properties. Here we establish a precise correspondence between graph topology and exchange symmetry by proving that a graph state is fully symmetric under p...

### [A Multi-directional Meta-Learning Framework for Class-Generalizable Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19833v1)
**Authors:** Padmaksha Roy, Lamine Mili, Almuatazbellah Boker  
**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and...

**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Neural scaling laws predict how language model performance improves with increased compute. While aggregate metrics like validation loss can follow smooth power-law curves, individual downstream tasks exhibit diverse scaling behaviors: some improve monotonically, others plateau, and some even degrade with scale. We argue that predicting downstream performance from validation perplexity suffers fro...

**Abstract:** There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we addres...

**Published:** 2026-01-27  
**Updated:** 2026-01-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The minimum error probability for distinguishing between two quantum states is bounded by the Helstrom limit, derived under the assumption that measurement strategies are restricted to positive operator-valued measurements. We explore scenarios in which the error probability for discriminating two quantum states can be reduced below the Helstrom bound under some constrained access of resources, in...
