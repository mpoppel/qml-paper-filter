### [Feature Identification via the Empirical NTK](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00468v2)
**Authors:** Jennifer Lin  
**Published:** 2025-10-01  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with ground-truth features. In...

It is established that Trotter error can be bounded in terms of spectral norms of nested commutators of the Hamiltonian partitions [Childs et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011020], but evaluating these expressions...

**Published:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed inductive bias. Our method combine...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-lat, hep-ph, hep-th  

**Abstract:** We investigate the time dependence of anti-flatness in the entanglement spectrum, a measure for non-stabilizerness and lower bound for non-local quantum magic, on a subsystem of a linear SU(2) plaquette chain during thermalization. Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states, we find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time period when the entanglem...

**Abstract:** Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks or KANs have shown the ability to outperform classical Deep Neural Networks, while using far fewer trainable parameters for regression problems on scientific domains. Even more powerful has been their interpretability due to their structure being composed of univariate B-Spline functions. This enables us to derive closed-form equations from trained KANs for a wide range ...

**Published:** 2025-10-13  
**Updated:** 2025-10-13  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) excel at complex reasoning but are traditionally evaluated in static, "frozen world" settings: model responses are assumed to be instantaneous, and the context of a request is presumed to be immutable over the duration of the response. While generally true for short-term tasks, the "frozen world" assumption breaks down in modern reasoning tasks such as assistive progr...

**Abstract:** Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments. Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with sampling-based Mode...

**Abstract:** Synchronization in quantum systems has been recently studied through persistent oscillations of local observables, which stem from undamped modes of the dissipative dynamics. However, the existence of such modes requires fine-tuning the system to satisfy specific symmetry constraints. We investigate the response of spin systems that possess such oscillating modes to generic, weak perturbations. We...
