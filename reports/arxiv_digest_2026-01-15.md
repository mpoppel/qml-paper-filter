### [Dissipative State Engineering of Complex Entanglement with Markovian Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09597v1)
**Authors:** Manish Chaudhary  
**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Highly multipartite entangled states play an important role in various quantum computing tasks. We investigate the dissipative generation of a complex entanglement structure as in a cluster state through engineered Markovian dynamics in the spin systems coupled via Ising interactions. Using the Lindblad master equation, we design a projection based dissipative channel that drives the system toward...

### [Spectral Distribution of Exceptional Points in Lattices with Localized Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09628v1)
**Authors:** J. R. Silva  
**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** physics.optics, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We explore the existence and stability of exceptional points (EPs) in finite waveguide arrays subject to single-site dissipation. We show that the EP landscape is dictated by a geometry-dependent parity effect, leading to strictly distinct spectral behaviors for arrays with even versus odd numbers of waveguides. Through analytical derivation and numerical analysis, we define the conditions under w...

### [Non-invertible circuit complexity from fusion operations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09535v1)
**Authors:** Saskia Demulder  
**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Modern understanding of symmetry in quantum field theory includes both invertible and non-invertible operations. Motivated by this, we extend Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity to incorporate non-invertible gates. These arise naturally from fusion of topological defects and allow transitions between superselection sectors. We realise fusion operations as completely positive...

**Authors:** Chi-Pin Huang, Yunze Man, Zhiding Yu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** Vision-Language-Action (VLA) tasks require reasoning over complex visual scenes and executing adaptive actions in dynamic environments. While recent studies on reasoning VLAs show that explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) can improve generalization, they suffer from high inference latency due to lengthy reasoning traces. We propose Fast-ThinkAct, an efficient reasoning framework that achieves compact y...

### [Value-Aware Numerical Representations for Transformer Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09706v1)
**Authors:** Andreea Dutulescu, Stefan Ruseti, Mihai Dascalu  
**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models often achieve strong results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks while remaining fragile on basic numerical understanding and arithmetic operations. A central limitation is that numbers are processed as symbolic tokens whose embeddings do not explicitly encode numerical value, leading to systematic errors. We introduce a value-aware numerical representation that ...

**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) routers dynamically select optimal models for given inputs. Existing approaches typically assume access to ground-truth labeled data, which is often unavailable in practice, especially when user request distributions are heterogeneous and unknown. We introduce Routing with Generated Data (RGD), a challenging setting in which routers are trained exclusively on generated q...

### [Quantum graphs of homomorphisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09685v1)
**Authors:** Andre Kornell, Bert Lindenhovius  
**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph, math.CT, math.OA  

**Abstract:** We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is no...

**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) combined with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising direction for parameter-efficient deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). By sharing a single adapter across multiple tasks, one can significantly reduce storage overhead. However, this approach suffers from negative transfer, where conflicting gradient updates from distinct tasks degrade the performa...

**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Tabular Foundation Models (TFMs) have recently shown strong in-context learning capabilities on structured data, achieving zero-shot performance comparable to traditional machine learning methods. We find that zero-shot TFMs already achieve strong performance, while the benefits of fine-tuning are highly model and data-dependent. Meta-learning and PEFT provide moderate gains under specific conditi...

**Published:** 2026-01-14  
**Updated:** 2026-01-14  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.CR, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly popular, producing a large share of AI-generated images online. To compare model quality, voting-based leaderboards have become the standard, relying on anonymized model outputs for fairness. In this work, we show that such anonymity can be easily broken. We find that generations from each T2I model form distinctive clusters in the image embedding space,...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, eess.SY  

**Abstract:** Efficiently optimizing battery charging protocols is challenging because each evaluation is slow, costly, and non-differentiable. Many existing approaches address this difficulty by heavily constraining the protocol search space, which limits the diversity of protocols that can be explored, preventing the discovery of higher-performing solutions. We introduce two gradient-free, LLM-driven closed-l...

**Abstract:** Machine unlearning is becoming essential for building trustworthy and compliant language models. Yet unlearning success varies considerably across individual samples: some are reliably erased, while others persist despite the same procedure. We argue that this disparity is not only a data-side phenomenon, but also reflects model-internal mechanisms that encode and protect memorized information. We...
