### [A Practitioner's Guide to Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25781v1)
**Authors:** Amir Noorizadegan, Sifan Wang, Leevan Ling  
**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**Updated:** 2025-10-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NA, cs.NE, math.NA  

**Abstract:** Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to traditional Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. Unlike MLPs, which use fixed activation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions on edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review provides a systematic and com...

### [LLMs Process Lists With General Filter Heads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26784v1)
**Authors:** Arnab Sen Sharma, Giordano Rogers, Natalie Shapira et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We investigate the mechanisms underlying a range of list-processing tasks in LLMs, and we find that LLMs have learned to encode a compact, causal representation of a general filtering operation that mirrors the generic "filter" function of functional programming. Using causal mediation analysis on a diverse set of list-processing tasks, we find that a small number of attention heads, which we dub ...

**Abstract:** We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifyi...

**Abstract:** How can we explain the influence of training data on black-box models? Influence functions (IFs) offer a post-hoc solution by utilizing gradients and Hessians. However, computing the Hessian for an entire dataset is resource-intensive, necessitating a feasible alternative. A common approach involves randomly sampling a small subset of the training data, but this method often results in highly inco...

**Abstract:** Wigner negativity and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) are key nonclassical resources that enable computational advantages and broader quantum-information tasks. In this work, we prove two theorems for multimode continuous-variable systems that relate these nonclassical resources. Both theorems show that "enough" Wigner negativity -- either a large-enough Wigner negativity volume along a su...

**Abstract:** Additional state evolutions performed before measurement, also called measurement-after-interactions (MAI) protocols, have shown a great potential for increasing the sensitivity of metrological scenarios. Here, we go beyond this result and show that MAI techniques can significantly enhance the detection capability of witnesses for quantum correlations. In particular, we show the possibility of det...

**Authors:** William Overman, Mohsen Bayati  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** As increasingly capable agents are deployed, a central safety question is how to retain meaningful human control without modifying the underlying system. We study a minimal control interface where an agent chooses whether to act autonomously (play) or defer (ask), while a human simultaneously chooses whether to be permissive (trust) or to engage in oversight (oversee). If the agent defers, the hum...

**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.MM  

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit a pronounced preference for textual inputs when processing vision-language data, limiting their ability to reason effectively from visual evidence. Unlike prior studies that attribute this text bias to external factors such as data imbalance or instruction tuning, we propose that the bias originates from the model's internal architecture. Specifical...

**Abstract:** The "end-to-end" label for LLMs is a misnomer. In practice, they depend on a non-differentiable decoding process that requires laborious, hand-tuning of hyperparameters like temperature and top-p. This paper introduces AutoDeco, a novel architecture that enables truly "end-to-end" generation by learning to control its own decoding strategy. We augment the standard transformer with lightweight head...

**Abstract:** We study nonstabilizerness on the information lattice, and demonstrate that noninteger local information directly indicates nonstabilizerness. For states with a clear separation of short- and large-scale information, noninteger total information at large scales $\Gamma$ serves as a witness of long-range nonstabilizerness. We propose a folding procedure to separate the global and edge-to-edge contr...
