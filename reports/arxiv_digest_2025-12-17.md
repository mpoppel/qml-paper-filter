### [Sequential realization of Quantum Instruments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14588v1)
**Authors:** Soham Sau, Michal Sedlák  
**Published:** 2025-12-16  
**Updated:** 2025-12-16  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In adaptive quantum circuits classical results of mid-circuit measurements determine the upcoming gates. This allows POVMs, quantum channels or more generally quantum instruments to be implemented sequentially, so that fewer qubits need to be used at each of the $N$ measurement steps. In this paper, we mathematically describe these problems via adaptive sequence of instruments (ASI) and show how a...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** In this work, we establish the strongest known lower bounds against QAC$^0$, while allowing its full power of polynomially many ancillae and gates. Our two main results show that:   (1) Depth 3 QAC$^0$ circuits cannot compute PARITY regardless of size, and require at least $Ω(\exp(\sqrt{n}))$ many gates to compute MAJORITY.   (2) Depth 2 circuits cannot approximate high-influence Boolean functions...
