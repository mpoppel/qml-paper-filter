**Abstract:** We explore the industrial and scientific applicability of the VQE-LSTM framework by integrating meta-learning with GPU accelerated quantum simulation using NVIDIA's CUDA-Q (CUDAQ) platform. This work demonstrates how an LSTM-FC meta-initialization module can extend the practical reach of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) in both chemistry and physics domains. In the chemical regime, the fr...

### [Steady state coherence in a qubit is incompatible with a quantum map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15790v1)
**Authors:** Hans C. Fogedby  
**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We consider the issue of steady state coherences in a single qubit in the case of a composite system-bath interaction as proposed in \cite{Guarnieri18}. Based on a field theoretical approach we reanalyse the issue within a Redfield description. We find that the Redfield approach in accordance with \cite{Guarnieri18} yields steady state coherences but violating the properties of a quantum map also ...

### [Ensemble-size-dependence of deep-learning post-processing methods that minimize an (un)fair score: motivating examples and a proof-of-concept solution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15830v1)
**Authors:** Christopher David Roberts  
**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** physics.ao-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Fair scores reward ensemble forecast members that behave like samples from the same distribution as the verifying observations. They are therefore an attractive choice as loss functions to train data-driven ensemble forecasts or post-processing methods when large training ensembles are either unavailable or computationally prohibitive. The adjusted continuous ranked probability score (aCRPS) is fa...

### [Operationalising the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis via Task Complexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15829v1)
**Authors:** Tomás Vergara-Browne, Darshan Patil, Ivan Titov et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The superficial alignment hypothesis (SAH) posits that large language models learn most of their knowledge during pre-training, and that post-training merely surfaces this knowledge. The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the le...

**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** A central challenge in large language model (LLM) editing is capability preservation: methods that successfully change targeted behavior can quietly game the editing proxy and corrupt general capabilities, producing degenerate behaviors reminiscent of proxy/reward hacking. We present CrispEdit, a scalable and principled second-order editing algorithm that treats capability preservation as an expli...

**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.RO, math.OC  

**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved strong results on high-dimensional control tasks, but applying RL to reachability problems raises a fundamental mismatch: reachability seeks to maximize the set of states from which a system remains safe indefinitely, while RL optimizes expected returns over a user-specified distribution. This mismatch can result in policies that pe...

### [Deformed Heisenberg algebra and its Hilbert space representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15801v1)
**Authors:** Latévi M. Lawson, Ibrahim Nonkané, Kinvi Kangni  
**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** math-ph, hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A deformation of Heisenberg algebra induces among other consequences a loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Therefore, these operators are not Hermitian, nor is the Hamiltonian operator built from them. In the present paper, we propose a position deformation of Heisenberg algebra with both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties. By using a pseudo-similarity ...

**Authors:** Max Springer, Chung Peng Lee, Blossom Metevier et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Fine-tuning aligned language models on benign tasks unpredictably degrades safety guardrails, even when training data contains no harmful content and developers have no adversarial intent. We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is s...

**Published:** 2026-02-17  
**Updated:** 2026-02-17  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** A growing literature uses large language models (LLMs) as synthetic participants to generate cost-effective and nearly instantaneous responses in social science experiments. However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each ...

**Abstract:** Northrop Frye's theory of four fundamental narrative genres (comedy, romance, tragedy, satire) has profoundly influenced literary criticism, yet computational approaches to his framework have focused primarily on narrative patterns rather than character functions. In this paper, we present a new character function framework that complements pattern-based analysis by examining how archetypal roles ...

**Abstract:** Energy consumption is becoming a serious bottleneck for integrating quantum technologies within the existing global information infrastructure. In photonic architectures, considerable energy overheads stem from using lasers, whose high coherence was long considered indispensable for quantum state preparation. Here, we demonstrate that natural, incoherent sunlight can successfully produce quantum-e...

**Abstract:** Nonlinear phase gates are essential to achieve the universality of continuous-variable quantum processing and its applications. We present a deterministic protocol for generating nonlinear phase gates in trapped ion systems using simultaneous two-tone sideband drives beyond the Lamb-Dicke regime. Our approach harnesses higher-order interaction terms typically neglected or suppressed to construct n...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Electron diffraction from nanogratings provides a platform for free-electron interferometry, yet controlled manipulation of electron spin in such geometries remains largely unexplored. In particular, the role of the self-generated magnetic field arising from electron motion and the feasibility of coherent spin control without disrupting diffraction coherence have not been quantitatively investigat...

**Abstract:** Spatiotemporal flows govern diverse phenomena across physics, biology, and engineering, yet modelling their multiscale dynamics remains a central challenge. Despite major advances in physics-informed machine learning, existing approaches struggle to simultaneously maintain long-term temporal evolution and resolve fine-scale structure across chaotic, turbulent, and physiological regimes. Here, we i...

**Abstract:** In systems with fast periodic driving, there are special subsets of (resonant) states, which behavior can be described with effective, time-independent Hamiltonian in a rotating reference frame. Here, we show that experimentally feasible system of ultracold bosonic atoms on a ring with rapidly oscillating scattering length can be used to simulate time-independent two-component atomic mixture with ...
