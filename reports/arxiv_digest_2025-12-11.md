### [Transpiling quantum circuits by a transformers-based algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09834v1)
**Authors:** Michele Banfi, Paolo Zentilini, Sebastiano Corli et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Transformers have gained popularity in machine learning due to their application in the field of natural language processing. They manipulate and process text efficiently, capturing long-range dependencies among data and performing the next word prediction. On the other hand, gate-based quantum computing is based on controlling the register of qubits in the quantum hardware by applying a sequence ...

### [Pinball: A Cryogenic Predecoder for Quantum Error Correction Decoding Under Circuit-Level Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09807v1)
**Authors:** Alexander Knapen, Guanchen Tao, Jacob Mack et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.AR, cs.ET  

**Abstract:** Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key challenge is the design of decoders for real-time quantum error correction (QEC), which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temper...

### [Photon emission by vortex particles accelerated in a linac](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09921v1)
**Authors:** A. Yu. Murtazin, G. K. Sizykh, D. V. Grosman et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** hep-ph, physics.acc-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study the photon emission by charged spinless particles with phase vortices and an orbital angular momentum (OAM) projection in longitudinal electric and magnetic fields within the scalar QED. A realistic wave packet of an electron or ion accelerated by a radio-frequency wave locally feels a constant and spatially homogeneous field, which allows us to develop an effective model for losing the a...

### [Analysis of Dirichlet Energies as Over-smoothing Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09890v1)
**Authors:** Anna Bison, Alessandro Sperduti  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We analyze the distinctions between two functionals often used as over-smoothing measures: the Dirichlet energies induced by the unnormalized graph Laplacian and the normalized graph Laplacian. We demonstrate that the latter fails to satisfy the axiomatic definition of a node-similarity measure proposed by Rusch \textit{et al.} By formalizing fundamental spectral properties of these two definition...

### [A 0.8395-approximation algorithm for the EPR problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09896v1)
**Authors:** Anuj Apte, Eunou Lee, Kunal Marwaha et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.DS  

**Abstract:** We give an efficient 0.8395-approximation algorithm for the EPR Hamiltonian. Our improvement comes from a new nonlinear monogamy-of-entanglement bound on star graphs and a refined parameterization of a shallow quantum circuit from previous works. We also prove limitations showing that current methods cannot achieve substantially better approximation ratios, indicating that further progress will re...

### [Error Mitigation of Fault-Tolerant Quantum Circuits with Soft Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09863v1)
**Authors:** Zeyuan Zhou, Shaun Pexton, Aleksander Kubica et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is typically viewed as a suite of practical techniques for today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices, with limited relevance once fault-tolerant quantum computers become available. In this work, we challenge this conventional wisdom by showing that QEM can continue to provide substantial benefits in the era of quantum error correction (QEC), and in an even mor...

**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** In this work, we present a practical and efficient framework for verifying entangled states when only a tomographically incomplete measurement setting is available-specifically, when access to observables is severely limited. We show how the experimental estimation of a small number of observables can be directly exploited to construct a large family of entanglement witnesses, enabling the efficie...

### [Optimal certification of constant-local Hamiltonians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09778v1)
**Authors:** Junseo Lee, Myeongjin Shin  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC, cs.DS, cs.IT, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We study the problem of certifying local Hamiltonians from real-time access to their dynamics. Given oracle access to $e^{-itH}$ for an unknown $k$-local Hamiltonian $H$ and a fully specified target Hamiltonian $H_0$, the goal is to decide whether $H$ is exactly equal to $H_0$ or differs from $H_0$ by at least $\varepsilon$ in normalized Frobenius norm, while minimizing the total evolution time. W...

**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.str-el, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Kondo effect, a hallmark of many-body physics, emerges from the antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins and conduction fermions, leading to a correlated many-body singlet state. Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we ...

### [Bayesian Networks, Markov Networks, Moralisation, Triangulation: a Categorical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09908v1)
**Authors:** Antonio Lorenzin, Fabio Zanasi  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LO, math.CT  

**Abstract:** Moralisation and Triangulation are transformations allowing to switch between different ways of factoring a probability distribution into a graphical model. Moralisation allows to view a Bayesian network (a directed model) as a Markov network (an undirected model), whereas triangulation addresses the opposite direction. We present a categorical framework where these transformations are modelled as...

### [Two simple models derived from a quantum-mechanical particle on an elliptical path](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09905v1)
**Authors:** Francisco M. Fernández  
**Published:** 2025-12-10  
**Updated:** 2025-12-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We analyze two simple models derived from a quantum-mechanical particle on an elliptical path. The first Hamiltonian operator is non-Hermitian but isomorphic to an Hermitian operator. It appears to exhibit the same two-fold degeneracy as the particle on a circular path. More precisely, $E_n=n^2E_1,\ n=1,2,\ldots$ (in addition to an exact eigenvalue $E_0=0$). The second Hamiltonian operator is Herm...

**Abstract:** While modern language models and their inner workings are incredibly complex, recent work (Golowich, Liu & Shetty; 2025) has proposed a simple and potentially tractable abstraction for them through the observation that empirically, these language models all seem to have approximately low logit rank. Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditi...
