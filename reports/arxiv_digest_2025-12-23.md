### [Trigonometric continuous-variable gates and hybrid quantum simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19582v1)
**Authors:** Tommaso Rainaldi, Victor Ale, Matt Grau et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat, hep-ph, nucl-th  

**Abstract:** Hybrid qubit-qumode quantum computing platforms provide a natural setting for simulating interacting bosonic quantum field theories. However, existing continuous-variable gate constructions rely predominantly on polynomial functions of canonical quadratures. In this work, we introduce a complementary universality paradigm based on trigonometric continuous-variable gates, which enable a Fourier-lik...

### [Extracting quantum field theory dynamics from an approximate ground state](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19594v1)
**Authors:** Sophie Mutzel, Antoine Tilloy  
**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat, hep-th  

**Abstract:** We develop a linear-programming method to extract dynamical information from static ground-state correlators in quantum field theory. We recast the Källén-Lehmann inversion as a convex optimization problem, in a spirit similar to the recent approach of Lawrence [arXiv:2408.11766]. This produces robust estimates of the smeared spectral density, the real-time propagator, and the mass gap directly fr...

### [Exponential-to-polynomial scaling of measurement overhead in circuit knitting via quantum tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19623v1)
**Authors:** Hiroyuki Harada, Kaito Wada, Naoki Yamamoto et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Circuit knitting is a family of techniques that enables large quantum computations on limited-size quantum devices by decomposing a target circuit into smaller subcircuits. However, it typically incurs a measurement overhead exponential in the number of cut locations, and it remains open whether this scaling is fundamentally unavoidable. In conventional circuit-cutting approaches based on the quas...

**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech, physics.comp-ph  

**Abstract:** We evaluate using programmable superconducting flux qubit D-Wave quantum annealers to approximate the partition function of Ising models. We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog...

Here, we investigate nonequilibrium quantum thermometry using a single-qubit probe coupled to a bosonic bath through noncommuting interaction operators, which unify pure dephasing and dissipative dynamics within a spin-boson model. We show that the interference between these two coupling channels ...

### [Bottom-up Policy Optimization: Your Language Model Policy Secretly Contains Internal Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19673v1)
**Authors:** Yuqiao Tan, Minzheng Wang, Shizhu He et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches treat large language models (LLMs) as a single unified policy, overlooking their internal mechanisms. Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic s...

**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Two-photon interference in a Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometer can be used as a quantum sensing mechanism due to the sensitivity of the interference dip to perturbations of the photon indistinguishability. In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation t...

**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum decoherence refers to the phenomenon when the interaction of a quantum system with its environment results in the degradation of quantum coherence. Decoherence is considered to be the most popular mechanism responsible for the emergence of classicality from quantum mechanics. The issue of formulating a measure of decoherence is addressed here. The approach taken here is that decoherence re...

### [Higher lattice gauge theory from representations of 2-groups and 3+1D topological phases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19608v1)
**Authors:** Latévi M. Lawson, Prince K. Osei  
**Published:** 2025-12-22  
**Updated:** 2025-12-22  
**Categories:** hep-lat, cond-mat.other, hep-th, math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We construct a higher lattice gauge theory based on the representation of 2-groups described by a category of crossed modules on a lattice model described by path 2-groupoids. Using these lattice gauge representations, an exactly solvable Hamiltonian for topological phases in 3+1 dimensions is constructed. We show that the ground states of this model are topological observables.
