### [Optimised Fermion-Qubit Encodings for Quantum Simulation with Reduced Transpiled Circuit Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13580v1)
**Authors:** Michael Williams de la Bastida, Thomas M. Bickley, Peter V. Coveney  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.ET  

**Abstract:** Simulation of fermionic Hamiltonians with gate-based quantum computers requires the selection of an encoding from fermionic operators to quantum gates, the most widely used being the Jordan-Wigner transform. Many alternative encodings exist, with quantum circuits and simulation results being sensitive to choice of encoding, device connectivity and Hamiltonian characteristics. Non-stochastic optimi...

### [Three-qubit entangling gates with simultaneous exchange controls in spin qubit systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13558v1)
**Authors:** Miguel G. Rodriguez, Yun-Pil Shim  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall  

**Abstract:** Pairwise exchange couplings have long been the standard mechanism for entangling spin qubits in semiconductor systems. However, implementing quantum circuits based on pairwise exchange gates often requires a lengthy sequence of elementary gate operations. In this work, we present an alternative approach: multi-qubit entangling gate operations that simultaneously drive the exchange couplings betwee...

### [Tensor Network Formulation of Dequantized Algorithms for Ground State Energy Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13548v1)
**Authors:** Hidetaka Manabe, Takanori Sugimoto, Keisuke Fujii  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Verifying quantum advantage for practical problems, particularly the ground state energy estimation (GSEE) problem, is one of the central challenges in quantum computing theory. For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically ...

### [Towards Quantum Advantage in Chemistry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13657v1)
**Authors:** Scott N. Genin, Ohyun Kwon, Seyyed Mehdi Hosseini Jenab et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** physics.chem-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Molecular simulations are widely regarded as leading candidates to demonstrate quantum advantage--defined as the point at which quantum methods surpass classical approaches in either accuracy or scale. Yet the qubit counts and error rates required to realize such an advantage remain uncertain; resource estimates for ground-state electronic structure span orders of magnitude, and no quantum-native ...

### [Certified-Everlasting Quantum NIZK Proofs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13628v1)
**Authors:** Nikhil Pappu  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** We study non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (NIZKs) for NP satisfying: 1) statistical soundness, 2) computational zero-knowledge and 3) certified-everlasting zero-knowledge (CE-ZK). The CE-ZK property allows a verifier of a quantum proof to revoke the proof in a way that can be checked (certified) by the prover. Conditioned on successful certification, the verifier's state can be efficiently si...

### [Pontryagin Maximum Principle for Rydberg-blockaded state-to-state transfers: A semi-analytic approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13549v1)
**Authors:** Federico Alberto Astolfi, Sven Jandura, Guido Pupillo  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math.OC  

**Abstract:** We study time-optimal state-to-state control for two- and multi-qubit operations motivated by neutral-atom quantum processors within the Rydberg blockade regime. Block-diagonalization of the Hamiltonian simplifies the dynamics and enables the application of a semi-analytic approach to the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to derive optimal laser controls. We provide a general formalism for $N$ qubits. ...

### [Quantum oracles give an advantage for identifying classical counterfactuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13692v1)
**Authors:** Ciarán M. Gilligan-Lee, Yìlè Yīng, Jonathan Richens et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfac...

**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.GR, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Video diffusion models have revolutionized generative video synthesis, but they are imprecise, slow, and can be opaque during generation -- keeping users in the dark for a prolonged period. In this work, we propose DiffusionBrowser, a model-agnostic, lightweight decoder framework that allows users to interactively generate previews at any point (timestep or transformer block) during the denoising ...

### [Feedforward 3D Editing via Text-Steerable Image-to-3D](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13678v1)
**Authors:** Ziqi Ma, Hongqiao Chen, Yisong Yue et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Recent progress in image-to-3D has opened up immense possibilities for design, AR/VR, and robotics. However, to use AI-generated 3D assets in real applications, a critical requirement is the capability to edit them easily. We present a feedforward method, Steer3D, to add text steerability to image-to-3D models, which enables editing of generated 3D assets with language. Our approach is inspired by...

### [Matter-Mediated Entanglement in Classical Gravity: Suppression by Binding Potentials and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13675v1)
**Authors:** Ziqian Tang, Chen Yang, Zizhao Han et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Aziz and Howl [Nature 646 (2025)] argue that two spatially separated masses can become entangled even when gravity is treated as a classical field, by invoking higher-order "virtual-matter" processes in a QFT description of matter, which is non-LOCC (local operations and classical communication). We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a qu...

### [Directional Textual Inversion for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13672v1)
**Authors:** Kunhee Kim, NaHyeon Park, Kibeom Hong et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Textual Inversion (TI) is an efficient approach to text-to-image personalization but often fails on complex prompts. We trace these failures to embedding norm inflation: learned tokens drift to out-of-distribution magnitudes, degrading prompt conditioning in pre-norm Transformers. Empirically, we show semantics are primarily encoded by direction in CLIP token space, while inflated norms harm conte...

### [Schrödinger Symmetry in Spherically-symmetric Static Mini-superspaces with Matter Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13651v1)
**Authors:** Taishi Sano, Yuki Yokokura  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** gr-qc, hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Schrödinger symmetry emerged in a ``fluid limit" from a full superspace to several mini-superspace models. We consider two spherically-symmetric static mini-superspace models with matter fields and verify the robustness of this emergent symmetry at the classical level: (i) Maxwell field with cosmological constant and (ii) $n$ massless scalar fields. We develop a method based on canonical transform...

### [Quadratic and cubic scrambling in the estimation of two successive phase-shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13640v1)
**Authors:** Manju, Stefano Olivares, Matteo G. A. Paris  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Multiparameter quantum estimation becomes challenging when the parameters are incompatible, i.e., when their respective symmetric logarithmic derivatives do not commute, or when the model is sloppy, meaning that the quantum probe depends only on combinations of parameters leading to a degenerate or ill-conditioned Fisher information matrix. In this work, we explore the use of scrambling operations...

**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, math.PR, math.ST  

**Abstract:** We consider statistical tasks in high dimensions whose loss depends on the data only through its projection into a fixed-dimensional subspace spanned by the parameter vectors and certain ground truth vectors. This includes classifying mixture distributions with cross-entropy loss with one and two-layer networks, and learning single and multi-index models with one and two-layer networks. When the d...

### [StutterFuse: Mitigating Modality Collapse in Stuttering Detection with Jaccard-Weighted Metric Learning and Gated Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13632v1)
**Authors:** Guransh Singh, Md Shah Fahad  
**Published:** 2025-12-15  
**Updated:** 2025-12-15  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Stuttering detection breaks down when disfluencies overlap. Existing parametric models struggle to distinguish complex, simultaneous disfluencies (e.g., a 'block' with a 'prolongation') due to the scarcity of these specific combinations in training data. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has revolutionized NLP by grounding models in external knowledge, this paradigm remains unexplored in ...

**Abstract:** In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction s...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.IT  

**Abstract:** We study the estimation of an unknown quantum channel $\mathcal{E}$ with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. We establish a connection between the query complexities in two models: (i) access to $\mathcal{E}$, and (ii) access to a random dilation of $\mathcal{E}$. Specifically, we show that for parallel (possibly coherent) testers, access to dilations does not...
