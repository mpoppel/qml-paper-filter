**Categories:** cs.LG, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.data-an, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{eff...

In the classical setting, replica exchange (or parallel tempering) is a powerful heuristic to accelerate mixing in these scenarios. In the quantum realm, preparing Gibbs states of Hamiltonians faces a similar challenge, whe...

**Published:** 2025-10-08  
**Updated:** 2025-10-08  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** We establish novel connections between magic in quantum circuits and communication complexity. In particular, we show that functions computable with low magic have low communication cost.   Our first result shows that the $\mathsf{D}\|$ (deterministic simultaneous message passing) cost of a Boolean function $f$ is at most the number of single-qubit magic gates in a quantum circuit computing $f$ wi...

### [Closed-Form Last Layer Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04606v1)
**Authors:** Alexandre Galashov, Nathaël Da Costa, Liyuan Xu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters, and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to alternating bet...

**Authors:** David Gosset, Robin Kothari, Chenyi Zhang  
**Published:** 2025-10-08  
**Updated:** 2025-10-08  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Prior work of Beverland et al. has shown that any exact Clifford+$T$ implementation of the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate must use at least $n$ $T$ gates. Here we show how to get away with exponentially fewer $T$ gates, at the cost of incurring a tiny $1/\mathrm{poly}(n)$ error that can be neglected in most practical situations. More precisely, the $n$-qubit Toffoli gate can be implemented to within error...

**Abstract:** Gaussian states are widely regarded as one of the most relevant classes of continuous-variable (CV) quantum states, as they naturally arise in physical systems and play a key role in quantum technologies. This motivates a fundamental question: given copies of an unknown CV state, how can we efficiently test whether it is Gaussian? We address this problem from the perspective of representation theo...

**Abstract:** Machine learning (ML) models memorize and leak training data, causing serious privacy issues to data owners. Training algorithms with differential privacy (DP), such as DP-SGD, have been gaining attention as a solution. However, DP-SGD adds a noise at each training iteration, which degrades the accuracy of the trained model. To improve accuracy, a new family of approaches adds carefully designed c...

### [On the Convergence of Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07290v1)
**Authors:** Guangliang Liu, Haitao Mao, Bochuan Cao et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-08  
**Updated:** 2025-10-08  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are able to improve their responses when instructed to do so, a capability known as self-correction. When instructions provide only a general and abstract goal without specific details about potential issues in the response, LLMs must rely on their internal knowledge to improve response quality, a process referred to as intrinsic self-correction. The empirical success ...
