### [Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit for QML](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17800v1)
**Authors:** Gurinder Singh, Thaddeus Pellegrini, Kenneth M. Merz,  
**Published:** 2025-12-19  
**Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Designing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that are expressive, trainable, and robust to hardware noise is a central challenge for quantum machine learning (QML) on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The...

**Published:** 2025-12-19  
**Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.NA, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Operator learning is a data-driven approximation of mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, such as the solution operators of partial differential equations. Kernel-based operator learning can offer accurate, theoretically justified approximations that require less training than standard methods. However, they can become computationally prohibitive for large training sets and can be...

### [Momentum correlations of the Hawking effect in a quantum fluid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17807v1)
**Authors:** Marcos Gil de Olivera, Malo Joly, Antonio Z. Khoury et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-19  
**Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, gr-qc, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Hawking effect -- the spontaneous emission of correlated quanta from horizons -- can be observed in laboratory systems where an acoustic horizon forms when a fluid transitions from subcritical to supercritical flow. Although most theoretical and experimental studies have relied on real-space observables, the frequency-dependent nature of the Hawking process motivates a momentum-space analysis ...

### [Proximity effect in asymmetric-gap superconducting bilayers and regularization of transition rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17765v1)
**Authors:** G. Marchegiani, G. Catelani  
**Published:** 2025-12-19  
**Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Categories:** cond-mat.supr-con, cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The standard mean-field treatment of low-temperature superconductors leads to a square-root divergent density of states at the gap value. This feature can lead to unphysical logarithmic divergences in various quantities, such as currents and qubit transition rates. We revisit their possible regularization based on the proximity effect between two superconducting films with different gaps. We deriv...

**Authors:** Lara Janiurek, Viv Kendon  
**Published:** 2025-12-19  
**Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We derive the continuous spacetime limit of the one dimensional lazy discrete time quantum walk, obtaining explicit macroscopic evolution equations for a three state model in the presence of decoherence. While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously...

**Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Non-Gaussian states of light are a critical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing and enhanced metrology, but are typically faint and often obtained via post-selection. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a bright non-Gaussian state by introducing a Kerr nonlinearity to a macroscopic state of light called bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). To characterize the resulting state, w...

### [Adversarial Robustness of Vision in Open Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17902v1)
**Authors:** Jonathon Fox, William J Buchanan, Pavlos Papadopoulos  
**Published:** 2025-12-19  
**Updated:** 2025-12-19  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** With the increase in deep learning, it becomes increasingly difficult to understand the model in which AI systems can identify objects. Thus, an adversary could aim to modify an image by adding unseen elements, which will confuse the AI in its recognition of an entity. This paper thus investigates the adversarial robustness of LLaVA-1.5-13B and Meta's Llama 3.2 Vision-8B-2. These are tested for un...
