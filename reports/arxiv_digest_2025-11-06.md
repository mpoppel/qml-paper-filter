### [Random Spiking Neural Networks are Stable and Spectrally Simple](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00904v1)
**Authors:** Ernesto Araya, Massimiliano Datres, Gitta Kutyniok  
**Published:** 2025-11-02  
**Updated:** 2025-11-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising paradigm for energy-efficient computation, yet their theoretical foundations-especially regarding stability and robustness-remain limited compared to artificial neural networks. In this work, we study discrete-time leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) SNNs through the lens of Boolean function analysis. We focus on noise sensitivity and stability in classifi...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) are powerful quantum generative models that sample according to the Born rule, with complexity-theoretic evidence suggesting potential quantum advantages for generative tasks. Here, we identify QCBMs as a quantum Fourier model independently of the loss function. This allows us to apply known dequantization conditions when the optimal quantum distribution is av...

**Abstract:** We propose a phase-coherent, narrowband magnetometer for searching couplings between axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) and electron spins, using gate-defined silicon quantum-dot spin qubits. With repeated Ramsey echo sequences and dispersive readout, the qubit precession response can be tracked with sub-Hz spectral resolution. The accessible axion mass window is determined using a series of fi...

### [Frequency shifts as a reflection of ground state squeezing and entanglement in two coupled harmonic oscillators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03687v1)
**Authors:** Safoura Mirkhalaf, Helmut Ritsch, Karol Gietka  
**Published:** 2025-11-05  
**Updated:** 2025-11-05  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** It is often argued that two coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, even when cooled to their ground state, display no inherently quantum features beyond quantized energy levels. Here, we challenge this view by showing that their classical observables can encode genuinely quantum features. In particular, we demonstrate that the characteristic frequency shifts observed in such systems act as a signat...

**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable transition from offline to onl...

**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Colorectal cancer (CRC) grading is a critical prognostic factor but remains hampered by inter-observer variability and the privacy constraints of multi-institutional data sharing. While deep learning offers a path to automation, centralized training models conflict with data governance regulations and neglect the diagnostic importance of multi-scale analysis. In this work, we propose a scalable, p...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard temperature scaling. For...

**Abstract:** Given a small random sample of $n$-bit strings labeled by an unknown Boolean function, which properties of this function can be tested computationally efficiently? We show an equivalence between properties that are efficiently testable from few samples and properties with structured symmetry, which depend only on the function's average values on parts of a low-complexity partition of the domain.

**Abstract:** We theoretically investigate the interplay of interactions and non-Hermiticity in the dynamics of two bosons on the one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice with non-reciprocal tunneling. We find that the non-reciprocity in the tunneling leads to the formation of an asymmetric density cone during the time-evolution of the system; the degree of asymmetry can be tuned by tuning the non-reciprocity para...

**Abstract:** We prove that there exist uniform $(+,\times,/)$-circuits of size $O(n^3)$ to compute the basis generating polynomial of regular matroids on $n$ elements. By tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a first examp...

In this setting, using automata to represent tasks enables the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler sub-tasks that can be assigned to agents. However, existing approaches remain sample-inefficient and are limited to the single-task case...

However, machine learning and side-channel attacks increasingly undermine their classical assumptions, calling for new approaches to ensure unforgeability. Quantum mechanics naturally supports this goal through intrinsic randomness and the no-cloning theorem, ...
