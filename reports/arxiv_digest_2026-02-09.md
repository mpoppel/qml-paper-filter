### [Phase-sensitive characterization of a quantum frequency converter by spectral interferometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06796v1)
**Authors:** Mateusz J Olszewski, Kasper Hecht Alexander, Michael T M Woodley et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We introduce an experimental technique for complete phase-sensitive characterization of arbitrary unitary spectral-temporal transformations of optical modes. Our method recovers the complex spectral transfer function, or Green's function, of a frequency converter by analyzing spectral interference in the response to a tunable bichromatic probe. We perform a proof-of-concept experiment on a frequen...

**Authors:** Uday Sannigrahi, Amlan Chakrabarti, Swapnil Saha et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** To reduce circuit depth when executing Quantum algorithms, it is necessary to maximize qubit connectivity on a near-term quantum processor. While addressing this, we also need to ensure high gate fidelity, suppression of unwanted ZZ cross-talk, a compact layout footprint, and minimal control hardware complexity to support scalability. In current superconducting quantum chips, fixed coupling is use...

### [Symmetry and localisation in causally constrained quantum operator dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06913v1)
**Authors:** Marcell D. Kovács, Christopher J. Turner, Lluís Masanes  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.other, math-ph  

**Abstract:** This paper explores the connection between causality and many-body dynamics by studying the algebraic structure of tri-partite unitaries ('walls') which permanently arrest local operator spreading in their time-periodic evolution. We show that the resulting causally independent subsystems arise from the invariance of an embedded sub-algebra in the system (ie. a generalised symmetry) that leads to ...

### [Decoupling Variance and Scale-Invariant Updates in Adaptive Gradient Descent for Unified Vector and Matrix Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06880v1)
**Authors:** Zitao Song, Cedar Site Bai, Zhe Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural gener...

**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Topological superconductors (TSCs) provide a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum information processing. However, the canonical Majorana platform based on $2e$ TSCs remains computationally constrained. In this work, we find a $4e$ TSC that overcomes these constraints by combining a charge-$4e$ condensate with an Abelian chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ topological order in an intertwined fashion. Remar...

### [Learning a Generative Meta-Model of LLM Activations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06964v1)
**Authors:** Grace Luo, Jiahai Feng, Trevor Darrell et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-mo...

**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large reasoning models achieve strong performance by scaling inference-time chain-of-thought, but this paradigm suffers from quadratic cost, context length limits, and degraded reasoning due to lost-in-the-middle effects. Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to opt...

**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Can AI agents predict whether they will succeed at a task? We study agentic uncertainty by eliciting success probability estimates before, during, and after task execution. All results exhibit agentic overconfidence: some agents that succeed only 22% of the time predict 77% success. Counterintuitively, pre-execution assessment with strictly less information tends to yield better discrimination tha...

### [Endogenous Resistance to Activation Steering in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06941v1)
**Authors:** Alex McKenzie, Keenan Pepper, Stijn Servaes et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Ge...

**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, ...

**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before...

**Abstract:** Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we int...

### [A Cycle-Consistent Graph Surrogate for Full-Cycle Left Ventricular Myocardial Biomechanics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06884v1)
**Authors:** Siyu Mu, Wei Xuan Chan, Choon Hwai Yap  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Image-based patient-specific simulation of left ventricular (LV) mechanics is valuable for understanding cardiac function and supporting clinical intervention planning, but conventional finite-element analysis (FEA) is computationally intensive. Current graph-based surrogates do not have full-cycle prediction capabilities, and physics-informed neural networks often struggle to converge on complex ...

### [Vision Transformer Finetuning Benefits from Non-Smooth Components](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06883v1)
**Authors:** Ambroise Odonnat, Laetitia Chapel, Romain Tavenard et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average ...

**Authors:** Sankar B, Amogh A S, Sandhya Baranwal et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.HC, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** During product conceptualization, capturing the non-linear history and cognitive intent is crucial. Traditional sketching tools often lose this context. We introduce DIMES (Design Idea Management and Evolution capture System), a web-based environment featuring sGIT (SketchGit), a custom visual version control architecture, and Generative AI. sGIT includes AEGIS, a module using hybrid Deep Learning...

### [Zero-shot Generalizable Graph Anomaly Detection with Mixture of Riemannian Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06859v1)
**Authors:** Xinyu Zhao, Qingyun Sun, Jiayi Luo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Graph Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to identify irregular patterns in graph data, and recent works have explored zero-shot generalist GAD to enable generalization to unseen graph datasets. However, existing zero-shot GAD methods largely ignore intrinsic geometric differences across diverse anomaly patterns, substantially limiting their cross-domain generalization. In this work, we reveal that anoma...

### [Comment on "Relativistic covariance and nonlinear quantum mechanics: Tomonaga-Schwinger analysis''](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06845v1)
**Authors:** Lajos Diósi  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Contrary to the central claim (Hsu, 2026) published in Physics Letters B, the Tomonaga--Schwinger equation remains covariant despite the nonlinear modification of it. The proof of covariance becomes simple after the loopholes and mistakes in Hsu's arguments are identified.

**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.   To address...

**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic ...

### [Heralding efficiency and brightness optimization of a micro-ring resonator via tunable coupling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06790v1)
**Authors:** Nathan Moses, Marcus J. Clark, Alex S. Clark et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Efficient and bright single photon sources on photonic chips are key to scaling quantum technologies. Spontaneous four wave mixing in micro-ring resonators creates excellent narrowband and tunable photon sources. We experimentally demonstrate the optimization of heralding efficiency and brightness by tuning the coupling of the pump, signal and idler modes into the resonator whilst operating in a p...

### [Bridging Quantum and Semi-Classical Thermodynamics in Cavity QED](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06744v1)
**Authors:** Marcelo Janovitch, Sander Stammbach, Matteo Brunelli et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-06  
**Updated:** 2026-02-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), photons leaving the cavity can be irreversibly lost or reused as a power source. This dichotomy is reflected in two different thermodynamic bookkeepings of the light field, both corresponding to valid thermodynamic frameworks. In this work, we formulate a rigorous semi-classical limit of cavity QED and show that the resulting thermodynamic description may q...
