### [A Study of Entanglement and Ansatz Expressivity for the Transverse-Field Ising Model using Variational Quantum Eigensolver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17662v1)
**Authors:** Ashutosh P. Tripathi, Nilmani Mathur, Vikram Tripathi  
**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating many-body systems in the NISQ era. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the faithful preparation of eigenstates, which becomes challenging in degenerate and strongly entangled regimes. We study this problem using the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with periodic boundary conditions in one...

### [Scalable, self-verifying variational quantum eigensolver using adiabatic warm starts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17612v1)
**Authors:** Bojan Žunkovič, Marco Ballarin, Lewis Wright et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study an adiabatic variant of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) in which VQE is performed iteratively for a sequence of Hamiltonians along an adiabatic path. We derive the conditions under which gradient-based optimization successfully prepares the adiabatic ground states. These conditions show that the barren plateau problem and local optima can be avoided. Additionally, we propose usi...

### [Efficiency of classical simulations of a noisy Grover algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17569v1)
**Authors:** Raphaël Menu, Johannes Schachenmayer  
**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We analyze the modification of entanglement dynamics in the Grover algorithm when the qubits are subjected to single-qubit amplitude-damping or phase-flip noise. We compare quantum trajectories with full density-matrix simulations, analyzing the dynamics of averaged trajectory entanglement (TE) and operator entanglement (OE), in the respective state representation. Although not a genuine entanglem...

### [Approaching the Limit in Multiparameter AC Magnetometry with Quantum Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17648v1)
**Authors:** Takuya Isogawa, Zhiyao Hu, Ayumi Kanamoto et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Simultaneously estimating multiple parameters at the ultimate limit is a central challenge in quantum metrology, often hindered by inherent incompatibilities in optimal estimation strategies. At its most extreme, this incompatibility culminates in a fundamental impossibility when the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM) becomes singular, rendering joint estimation unattainable. This is the cas...

### [When to Trust the Cheap Check: Weak and Strong Verification for Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17633v1)
**Authors:** Shayan Kiyani, Sima Noorani, George Pappas et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Reasoning with LLMs increasingly unfolds inside a broader verification loop. Internally, systems use cheap checks, such as self-consistency or proxy rewards, which we call weak verification. Externally, users inspect outputs and steer the model through feedback until results are trustworthy, which we call strong verification. These signals differ sharply in cost and reliability: strong verificatio...

**Authors:** Jona Erle, Balint Koczor  
**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** While ground-state preparation is expected to be a primary application of quantum computers, it is also an essential subroutine for many fault-tolerant algorithms. In early fault-tolerant regimes, logical measurements remain costly, motivating adaptive, shot-frugal state-preparation strategies that efficiently utilize each measurement. We introduce the Shadow Enhanced Greedy Quantum Eigensolver (S...

### [Sink-Aware Pruning for Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17664v1)
**Authors:** Aidar Myrzakhan, Tianyi Li, Bowei Guo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) incur high inference cost due to iterative denoising, motivating efficient pruning. Existing pruning heuristics largely inherited from autoregressive (AR) LLMs, typically preserve attention sink tokens because AR sinks serve as stable global anchors. We show that this assumption does not hold for DLMs: the attention-sink position exhibits substantially higher varia...

**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Critical quantum field theories occupy a central position in modern theoretical physics for their inherent universality stemming from long-range correlations. As an example, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) describes a wealth of one-dimensional quantum systems at low temperatures. Its behavior is deeply rooted in the emergence of an effective Fermi sea, leading to power-law correlations and Fri...

**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Modern offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods find performant actor-critics, however, fine-tuning these actor-critics online with value-based RL algorithms typically causes immediate drops in performance. We provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that, in the loss landscape, offline maxima for prior algorithms and online maxima are separated by low-performance valleys that gradient-b...

**Abstract:** We study the topology of the loss landscape of one-hidden-layer ReLU networks under overparameterization. On the theory side, we (i) prove that for convex $L$-Lipschitz losses with an $\ell_1$-regularized second layer, every pair of models at the same loss level can be connected by a continuous path within an arbitrarily small loss increase $ε$ (extending a known result for the quadratic loss); (i...

**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The simple harmonic oscillator has a well-known normalizable, positive energy, bound state spectrum. We show that degenerate with each such positive energy eigenvalue there is a non-normalizable positive energy eigenstate whose eigenfunction is orthogonal to that of the standard energy eigenfunction. This class of states is not built on the vacuum that $a$ annihilates, but is instead built on the ...

**Published:** 2026-02-19  
**Updated:** 2026-02-19  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** As models and data scale, independently trained networks often induce analogous notions of similarity. But, matching similarities is weaker than establishing an explicit correspondence between the representation spaces, especially for multimodal models, where consistency must hold not only within each modality, but also for the learned image-text coupling. We therefore ask: given two independently...

**Abstract:** We consider rectilinear free-space propagation of electromagnetic wavepackets using electromagnetic field theory, scalar wavepacket propagation, and quantum-mechanical formalism. We demonstrate that spatially localized wavepackets are inherently characterized by a subluminal group velocity and a superluminal phase velocity, whose product equals $c^2$. These velocities are also known as the 'energy...
