### [Reward Models are Metrics in a Trench Coat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03231v1)
**Authors:** Sebastian Gehrmann  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The emergence of reinforcement learning in post-training of large language models has sparked significant interest in reward models. Reward models assess the quality of sampled model outputs to generate training signals. This task is also performed by evaluation metrics that monitor the performance of an AI model. We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to redundant termin...

### [Improving GUI Grounding with Explicit Position-to-Coordinate Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03230v1)
**Authors:** Suyuchen Wang, Tianyu Zhang, Ahmed Masry et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** GUI grounding, the task of mapping natural-language instructions to pixel coordinates, is crucial for autonomous agents, yet remains difficult for current VLMs. The core bottleneck is reliable patch-to-pixel mapping, which breaks when extrapolating to high-resolution displays unseen during training. Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual features, forcing the m...

While multiple statistically secure blind verification schemes in the prepare-and-send model have been proposed, none of them achieves full quantum fault-tolerance, a prerequisite for useful verification on scalable quantum computers. In this paper, we present the first fault-...

### [Absence of quantum Darwinism as a resource in secure quantum communication and computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03225v1)
**Authors:** Bishal Kumar Das, Sourav Manna, Vaibhav Madhok  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The emergence of classical world from underlying quantum mechanics is characterized by not only vanishing quantum correlations but also an unfolding of objectivity also known as quantum Darwinism. We show that the absence of this objectivity has a quantum advantage in cryptography and also provides the crucial missing link in efficient classical simulation of quantum circuits with zero discord. Fo...

### [Test-Time Defense Against Adversarial Attacks via Stochastic Resonance of Latent Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03224v1)
**Authors:** Dong Lao, Yuxiang Zhang, Haniyeh Ehsani Oskouie et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We propose a test-time defense mechanism against adversarial attacks: imperceptible image perturbations that significantly alter the predictions of a model. Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing, which can lead to information loss, we propose to "combat noise with noise" by leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing information loss. Our ap...

### [Self-Anchor: Large Language Model Reasoning via Step-by-step Attention Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03223v1)
**Authors:** Hongxiang Zhang, Yuan Tian, Tianyi Zhang  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** To solve complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), prompting-based methods offer a lightweight alternative to fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. However, as reasoning chains extend, critical intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context, receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline th...

### [Low-probability Tokens Sustain Exploration in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03222v1)
**Authors:** Guanhua Huang, Tingqiang Xu, Mingze Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploratio...

**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** Coin-flipping is a fundamental task in two-party cryptography where two remote mistrustful parties wish to generate a shared uniformly random bit. While quantum protocols promising near-perfect security exist for weak coin-flipping -- when the parties want opposing outcomes -- it has been shown that they must be inefficient in terms of their round complexity, and it is an open question of how spac...

**Authors:** José Cambronero, Michele Tufano, Sherry Shi et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.SE, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce t...

### [Cache-to-Cache: Direct Semantic Communication Between Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03215v1)
**Authors:** Tianyu Fu, Zihan Min, Hanling Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG, 68T07, 68T50, I.2.7  

**Abstract:** Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated...

**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning (RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to disentangle the task of "learn...

### [Best-of-Majority: Minimax-Optimal Strategy for Pass@$k$ Inference Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03199v1)
**Authors:** Qiwei Di, Kaixuan Ji, Xuheng Li et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently, evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses, and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we study inference scal...

**Abstract:** We study the Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning (RL) under distribution shifts in both finite-horizon episodic and infinite-horizon discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In the finite-horizon case, the transition functions may suddenly change at a particular episode. In the infinite-horizon setting, such changes can occur at an arbitrary time step during the agent's interaction with the ...

**Published:** 2025-10-03  
**Updated:** 2025-10-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Learning rate warm-up - increasing the learning rate at the beginning of training - has become a ubiquitous heuristic in modern deep learning, yet its theoretical foundations remain poorly understood. In this work, we provide a principled explanation for why warm-up improves training. We rely on a generalization of the $(L_0, L_1)$-smoothness condition, which bounds local curvature as a linear fun...

**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We identify the mechanism of slow heterogeneous relaxation in quantum kinetically constrained models (KCMs) in which the potential energy strength is controlled by a coupling parameter. The regime of slow relaxation includes the large-coupling limit. By expanding around that limit, we reveal a \emph{nested hierarchy} of states that remain frozen on time scales determined by powers of the coupling....

**Abstract:** We consider the class of Davies quantum semigroups modelling thermalization for translation-invariant Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes in D dimensions. We prove that conditions of Dobrushin-Shlosman-type on the quantum Gibbs state imply a modified logarithmic Sobolev inequality with a constant that is uniform in the system's size. This is accomplished by generalizing parts of the classical resul...

**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat  

**Abstract:** We investigate the role of symmetries in constructing resource-efficient operator pools for adaptive variational quantum eigensolvers. In particular, we focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a discretized model of $1+1$ dimensional electrodynamics, which we use as a proxy for spin chains with a continuum limit. We present an extensive set of simulations comprising a total of $11$ different operato...

**Abstract:** Recently, BCFT and ICFT have been generalized to the CFT on networks (NCFT). A key aspect of NCFT is how we connect the CFTs in different edges at the nodes of the network. For a free scalar field, one naturally requires that the scalar fields are continuous at the nodes. In this paper, we introduce a new junction condition that instead requires the normal derivative of the scalar field to be cont...

**Categories:** cs.IT, math.IT, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Dating back to the seminal work of von Neumann [von Neumann, Automata Studies, 1956], it is known that error correcting codes can overcome faulty circuit components to enable robust computation. Choosing an appropriate code is non-trivial as it must balance several requirements. Increasing the rate of the code reduces the relative number of redundant bits used in the fault-tolerant circuit, while ...
