### [Entangled photon pair excitation and time-frequency filtered multidimensional photon correlation spectroscopy as a probe for dissipative exciton kinetics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20700v1)
**Authors:** Arunangshu Debnath, Shaul Mukamel  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In molecular aggregates, multiple delocalized exciton states interact with phonons, making the state-resolved spectroscopic monitoring of dynamics challenging. We propose a protocol that combines photon-entanglement-enhanced narrowband excitation of two-exciton states with time-frequency-filtered two-photon coincidence counting. It can alleviate bottlenecks associated with probing exciton dynamics...

### [Quantum teleportation in expanding FRW universe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20860v1)
**Authors:** Babak Vakili  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph, gr-qc, hep-th  

**Abstract:** We investigate the process of quantum teleportation in an expanding universe modeled by Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime, focusing on two cosmologically relevant scenarios: a power-law expansion and the de Sitter universe. Adopting a field-theoretical approach, we analyze the quantum correlations between two comoving observers who share an entangled mode of a scalar field. Using the Bogoliubov...

### [Symplectic Optimization on Gaussian States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20832v1)
**Authors:** Christopher Willby, Tomohiro Hashizume, Jason Crain et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Computing Gaussian ground states via variational optimization is challenging because the covariance matrices must satisfy the uncertainty principle, rendering constrained or Riemannian optimization costly, delicate, and thus difficult to scale, particularly in large and inhomogeneous systems. We introduce a symplectic optimization framework that addresses this challenge by parameterizing covarianc...

### [Spectrum-generating algebra and intertwiners of the resonant Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20752v1)
**Authors:** Andreas Fring, Ian Marquette, Takano Taira  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-th, math-ph  

**Abstract:** We study the quantum Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator at the resonant (equal-frequency) point, where the dynamics becomes non-diagonalisable and the conventional Fock-space construction collapses. At the classical level, the degenerate system admits more than one Hamiltonian formulation generating the same equations of motion, leading to a nontrivial quantisation ambiguity. Working first in the ghostly t...

**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Standard approaches to quantum error correction (QEC) require active maintenance using measurements and classical processing. The possibility of passive QEC has so far only been established in an unphysical number of spatial dimensions. In this work, we present a simple method for autonomous QEC in two spatial dimensions, formulated as a quantum cellular automaton with a fixed, local and translati...

### [Co-Designed Adaptive Quantum State Preparation Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20681v1)
**Authors:** Mafalda Ramôa, Luis Paulo Santos, Nicholas J. Mayhall et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We propose a co-designed variant of ADAPT-VQE (Co-ADAPT-VQE) where the quantum hardware is taken into account in the construction of the ansatz. This framework can be readily used to optimize state preparation circuits for any device, addressing shortcomings such as limited connectivity, short coherence times, and variable gate errors. We exemplify the impact of Co-ADAPT-VQE by creating state prep...

**Authors:** Immanuel Abdi, Akshat Gupta, Micah Mok et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** One of the biggest missing capabilities in current AI systems is the ability to learn continuously after deployment. Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to tra...

**Authors:** Aníbal Silva, Moisés Santos, André Restivo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Tabular data remains a challenging domain for generative models.

**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY, cs.IR  

**Abstract:** Despite growing efforts to mitigate unfairness in recommender systems, existing fairness-aware methods typically fix the fairness requirement at training time and provide limited post-training flexibility. However, in real-world scenarios, diverse stakeholders may demand differing fairness requirements over time, so retraining for different fairness requirements becomes prohibitive. To address thi...

### [Reward Models Inherit Value Biases from Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20838v1)
**Authors:** Brian Christian, Jessica A. F. Thompson, Elle Michelle Yang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CY  

**Abstract:** Reward models (RMs) are central to aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values but have received less attention than pre-trained and post-trained LLMs themselves. Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using vali...

**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Language model representations often contain linear directions that correspond to high-level concepts. Here, we study the dynamics of these representations: how representations evolve along these dimensions within the context of (simulated) conversations. We find that linear representations can change dramatically over a conversation; for example, information that is represented as factual at the ...

**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** Foundation models rely on in-context learning for personalized decision making. The limited size of this context window necessitates memory compression and retrieval systems like RAG. These systems however often treat memory as large offline storage spaces, which is unfavorable for embodied agents that are expected to operate under strict memory and compute constraints, online. In this work, we pr...

### [Training Reasoning Models on Saturated Problems via Failure-Prefix Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20829v1)
**Authors:** Minwu Kim, Safal Shrestha, Keith Ross  
**Published:** 2026-01-28  
**Updated:** 2026-01-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has substantially improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet training often stalls as problems become saturated. We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix condi...

**Categories:** cs.SE, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation but struggle with complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by integrating external knowledge, yet retrieval models often miss relevant context, and generation models hallucinate with irrelevant data. We propose Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) for semantic representation and fine-grained retrieval of code and...

**Abstract:** Preference-Conditioned Policy Learning (PCPL) in Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) aims to approximate diverse Pareto-optimal solutions by conditioning policies on user-specified preferences over objectives. This enables a single model to flexibly adapt to arbitrary trade-offs at run-time by producing a policy on or near the Pareto front. However, existing benchmarks for PCPL are large...

**Abstract:** As lattice gauge theories with non-trivial topological features are driven towards the continuum limit, standard Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations suffer for topological freezing, i.e., a dramatic growth of autocorrelations in topological observables. A widely used strategy is the adoption of Open Boundary Conditions (OBC), which restores ergodic sampling of topology but at the price of breakin...

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large language models are increasingly used to curate bibliographies, raising the question: are their reference lists distinguishable from human ones? We build paired citation graphs, ground truth and GPT-4o-generated (from parametric knowledge), for 10,000 focal papers ($\approx$ 275k references) from SciSciNet, and added a field-matched random baseline that preserves out-degree and field distrib...

**Abstract:** Label-free optical microscopy through absorption or scattering spectroscopy provides fundamental insights across biology and materials science, yet its sensitivity remains fundamentally limited by photon shot noise. While recent demonstrations of quantum nonlinear microscopy show sub-shot-limited sensitivity, they are intrinsically limited by availability of high peak-power squeezed light sources....
