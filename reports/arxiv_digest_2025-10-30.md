**Authors:** Sandra Ranilla-Cortina, Diego A. Aranda, Jorge Ballesteros et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In this paper, we address the challenge of multivariate time-series forecasting using quantum machine learning techniques. We introduce adaptation strategies that extend variational quantum circuit models, traditionally limited to univariate data, toward the multivariate setting, exploring both purely quantum and hybrid quantum-classical formulations. First, we extend and benchmark several VQC-bas...

### [Accurate Leakage Speculation for Quantum Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25661v1)
**Authors:** Chaithanya Naik Mude, Swamit Tannu  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.AR  

**Abstract:** Quantum Error Correction (QEC) protects qubits against bit- and phase-flip errors in the |0> or |1> subspace, but physical qubits can also leak into higher energy levels (e.g., |2>). Leakage is especially harmful, as it corrupts all subsequent syndrome measurements and can spread to neighboring qubits. Detecting leakage on data qubits is particularly challenging, since they are never measured dire...

**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A common method for reading out the state of a spin qubit is by latching one logical qubit state, either $|1\rangle$ or $|0\rangle$, onto a different, metastable charge state. Such a latched state can provide a superior charge sensing signal for qubit readout, and it can have a lifetime chosen to be long enough that the charge sensed readout can be high fidelity. However, the passive reset out of ...

### [Task Completion Agents are Not Ideal Collaborators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25744v1)
**Authors:** Shannon Zejiang Shen, Valerie Chen, Ken Gu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Current evaluations of agents remain centered around one-shot task completion, failing to account for the inherently iterative and collaborative nature of many real-world problems, where human goals are often underspecified and evolve. We argue for a shift from building and assessing task completion agents to developing collaborative agents, assessed not only by the quality of their final outputs ...

### [Hawk: Leveraging Spatial Context for Faster Autoregressive Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25739v1)
**Authors:** Zhi-Kai Chen, Jun-Peng Jiang, Han-Jia Ye et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding, which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without compromising quality. However, its a...

**Updated:** 2025-10-29  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, I.2.7; I.2.6; I.2.4; G.2.2  

**Abstract:** Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to 13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from ACT-R and...

### [LieSolver: A PDE-constrained solver for IBVPs using Lie symmetries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25731v1)
**Authors:** René P. Klausen, Ivan Timofeev, Johannes Frank et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-29  
**Updated:** 2025-10-29  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.NA, math.NA, physics.comp-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations, the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's accur...

**Abstract:** A conditional latent-diffusion based framework for solving the electromagnetic inverse scattering problem associated with microwave imaging is introduced. This generative machine-learning model explicitly mirrors the non-uniqueness of the ill-posed inverse problem. Unlike existing inverse solvers utilizing deterministic machine learning techniques that produce a single reconstruction, the proposed...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, math-ph, math.MP, nucl-th  

**Abstract:** We study the interplay of symmetries and Gaussianity in bosonic systems, under closed and open dynamics, and develop a resource theory of Gaussian asymmetry. Specifically, we focus on Gaussian symmetry-respecting (covariant) operations, which serve as the free operations in this framework. We prove that any such operation can be realized via Gaussian Hamiltonians that respect the symmetry under co...

**Abstract:** We study a recently discovered property of many-body quantum chaotic systems called ETH-monotonicity in two-dimensional systems. Our new results further support ETH-monotonicity in these higher dimensional systems. We show that the flattening rate of the $f$-function is directly proportional to the number of degrees of freedom in the system, so as $L^2$ where $L$ is the linear size of the system, ...

**Abstract:** Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks, gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however, traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences. Previous approaches, s...
