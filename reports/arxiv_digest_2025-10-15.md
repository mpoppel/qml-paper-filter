### [Dr.LLM: Dynamic Layer Routing in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12773v1)
**Authors:** Ahmed Heakl, Martin Gubri, Salman Khan et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) process every token through all layers of a transformer stack, causing wasted computation on simple queries and insufficient flexibility for harder ones that need deeper reasoning. Adaptive-depth methods can improve efficiency, but prior approaches rely on costly inference-time search, architectural changes, or large-scale retraining, and in practice often degrade accu...

### [Sample-Efficient Omniprediction for Proper Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12769v1)
**Authors:** Isaac Gibbs, Ryan J. Tibshirani  
**Published:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ME  

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a variant of omnipred...

### [AnyUp: Universal Feature Upsampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12764v1)
**Authors:** Thomas Wimmer, Prune Truong, Marie-Julie Rakotosaona et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training. Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time feature-agnostic ups...

**Abstract:** Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis. Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these questions fail to capture the d...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study measurement-induced entanglement generated by column-by-column sampling of noisy 2D random Clifford circuits of size $N$ and depth $T$. Focusing on the operator entanglement $S_{\rm op}$ of the sampling-induced boundary state, first, we reproduce in the noiseless limit a finite-depth transition from area- to volume-law scaling. With on-site probablistic trace noise at any constant rate $p...

**Published:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We consider quenches of a quantum system that is prepared in a canonical equilibrium state of one Hamiltonian and then evolves unitarily in time under a different Hamiltonian. Technically, our main result is a systematic expansion of the pre- and post-quench canonical ensembles in the quench strength. We first demonstrate how this can be used to predict the system's temperature after the quench fr...

**Authors:** Guo Qin, Zhi Chen, Yong Liu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial information fr...

**Abstract:** Unclonable cryptography leverages the quantum no-cloning principle to copy-protect cryptographic functionalities. While most existing works address the basic single-copy security, the stronger notion of multi-copy security remains largely unexplored.   We introduce a generic compiler that upgrades collusion-resistant unclonable primitives to achieve multi-copy security, assuming only one-way funct...

**Authors:** Tomaso Poggio  
**Published:** 2025-10-13  
**Updated:** 2025-10-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse} (bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if $f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mat...

**Abstract:** Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning. To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under Discourse Rel...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision ...
