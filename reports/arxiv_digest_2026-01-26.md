### [Generation of fully phase controlled two-photon entangled states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16875v1)
**Authors:** Ian Ford, Adrien Amour, Matthias Keller  
**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Control over the internal states of trapped ions makes them the ideal system to generate single and two-photon states. Coupling a single ion to an optical cavity enables efficient emission of single photons into a single spatial mode and grants control over their temporal shape, phase and frequency. Using the long coherence time of the ion's internal states and employing a scheme to protect the co...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Sharing genuine multipartite entanglement by considering collective use of copies of biseparable states, which are entangled across all bipartitions but lack genuine multipartite entanglement at the single-copy level, plays a central role in several quantum information processing protocols, and has been referred as genuine multipartite entanglement activation. We present a protocol for three-qutri...

### [Formalising an operational continuum limit of quantum combs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16974v1)
**Authors:** Clara Wassner, Jonáš Fuksa, Jens Eisert et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum combs are powerful conceptual tools for capturing multi-time processes in quantum information theory, constituting the most general quantum mechanical process. But, despite their causal nature, they lack a meaningful physical connection to time -- and are, by and large, arguably incompatible with it without extra structure. The subclass of quantum combs which assumes an underlying process ...

**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Three-dimensional molecular structure generation is typically performed at the level of individual atoms, yet molecular graph generation techniques often consider fragments as their structural units. Building on the advances in frame-based protein structure generation, we extend these fragmentation ideas to 3D, treating general molecules as sets of rigid-body motifs. Utilising this representation,...

**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We theoretically compare the quantum Fisher information (QFI) for three configurations of absorption spectroscopy with undetected idler photons: an SU(1,1) interferometer with inter-source idler loss, an induced-coherence (IC) setup in which the idler partially seeds a second squeezer together with a vacuum ancilla, and a distributed-loss (DL) scheme with in-medium attenuation. We calculate the QF...

**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only unde...

**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** To be discoverable in an embedding-based search process, each part of a document should be reflected in its embedding representation. To quantify any potential reflection biases, we introduce a permutation-based evaluation framework. With this, we observe that state-of-the-art embedding models exhibit systematic positional and language biases when documents are longer and consist of multiple segme...

**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically l...

**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** The sample complexity of multi-group learning is shown to improve in the group-realizable setting over the agnostic setting, even when the family of groups is infinite so long as it has finite VC dimension. The improved sample complexity is obtained by empirical risk minimization over the class of group-realizable concepts, which itself could have infinite VC dimension. Implementing this approach ...

**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink f...

**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** While raw cosine similarity in pretrained embedding spaces exhibits strong rank correlation with human judgments, anisotropy induces systematic miscalibration of absolute values: scores concentrate in a narrow high-similarity band regardless of actual semantic relatedness, limiting interpretability as a quantitative measure. Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, co...

**Abstract:** We study the fluctuation statistics of integrated currents in noisy quantum diffusive systems, focusing on the Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion and Inclusion Processes (QSSEP/QSSIP). These one-dimensional fermionic (QSSEP) and bosonic (QSSIP) models feature stochastic nearest-neighbor hopping driven by Brownian noise, together with boundary injection and removal processes. They provide solvable ...

### [Theory of Minimal Weight Perturbations in Deep Networks and its Applications for Low-Rank Activated Backdoor Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16880v1)
**Authors:** Bethan Evans, Jared Tanner  
**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.IT  

**Abstract:** The minimal norm weight perturbations of DNNs required to achieve a specified change in output are derived and the factors determining its size are discussed. These single-layer exact formulae are contrasted with more generic multi-layer Lipschitz constant based robustness guarantees; both are observed to be of the same order which indicates similar efficacy in their guarantees. These results are ...

**Abstract:** This paper introduces the N-Way Self-Evaluating Deliberation (NSED) protocol, a Runtime Mixture-of-Models (MoM) architecture that constructs emergent composite models from a plurality of distinct expert agents. Unlike traditional Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) which rely on static gating networks, NSED employs a Dynamic Expertise Broker - a runtime optimization engine that treats model selection as a va...

### [Reasoning Promotes Robustness in Theory of Mind Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16853v1)
**Authors:** Ian B. de Haan, Peter van der Putten, Max van Duijn  
**Published:** 2026-01-23  
**Updated:** 2026-01-23  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong performance on Theory of Mind (ToM) tests, prompting debate about the nature and true performance of the underlying capabilities. At the same time, reasoning-oriented LLMs trained via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) have achieved notable improvements across a range of benchmarks. This paper examines the behavior of such ...
