### [Feature-Modulated UFNO for Improved Prediction of Multiphase Flow in Porous Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20543v1)
**Authors:** Alhasan Abdellatif, Hannah P. Menke, Ahmed H. Elsheikh et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-25  
**Updated:** 2025-11-25  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The UNet-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator (UFNO) extends the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) by incorporating a parallel UNet pathway, enabling the retention of both high- and low-frequency components. While UFNO improves predictive accuracy over FNO, it inefficiently treats scalar inputs (e.g., temperature, injection rate) as spatially distributed fields by duplicating their values across the domai...

### [Concept-Aware Batch Sampling Improves Language-Image Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20643v1)
**Authors:** Adhiraj Ghosh, Vishaal Udandarao, Thao Nguyen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-25  
**Updated:** 2025-11-25  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** What data should a vision-language model be trained on? To answer this question, many data curation efforts center on the quality of a dataset. However, most of these existing methods are (i) offline, i.e. they produce a static dataset from a set of predetermined filtering criteria, and (ii) concept-agnostic, i.e. they use model-based filters which induce additional data biases. In this work, we g...

Our ancilla-free GF multiplication circuit has the gate count complexity of $O(m^{\log_2{3}})$, an improvement over the previous best bound of $O(m^2)$. This was achieved by developing an efficient $O(m)$ circuit for multiplication by t...

Most existing models rely on fixed-scale structural priors, such as patch-based tokenization, fixed frequency transformations, or frozen backbone architectures. This often leads to over-regularization of temporal dyna...

**Abstract:** Quantum error correction typically requires repeated syndrome extraction due to measurement noise, which results in substantial time overhead in fault-tolerant computation. Single-shot error correction aims to suppress errors using only one round of syndrome extraction. However, for most codes, it requires high-weight checks, which significantly degrade, and often eliminate, single-shot performanc...

**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling graph-structured data and have been widely used in recommender systems, such as for capturing complex user-item and item-item relations. However, most industrial deployments adopt a two-stage pipeline: GNNs are first pre-trained offline to generate node embeddings, which are then used as static features for downstream recomme...

**Abstract:** The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) -- the anomalous boundary accumulation of an extensive number of bulk modes -- has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with broad implications for transport, sensing, and topological classification. A central open question is how magnetic or synthetic gauge fields influence this boundary phenomenon. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for magne...

### [Triangle Inequality for a Quantum Wasserstein Divergence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20450v1)
**Authors:** Melchior Wirth  
**Published:** 2025-11-25  
**Updated:** 2025-11-25  
**Categories:** math-ph, math.FA, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We resolve a conjecture of De Palma and Trevisan by proving the triangle inequality for a quantum 2-Wasserstein distance. The proof relies on complex analysis methods to establish a new integral representation of the cost in the optimal transport problem.
