**Abstract:** A spin precessing in a magnetic field is often used as a quantum clock, for example in tunneling-time measurements. We show that such a clock can exist in a coherent superposition of opposite temporal orientations, treating the arrow of time as a quantum two-level system. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with equal and opposite magnetic fields provides a simple implementation, enabling interference b...

**Published:** 2025-11-10  
**Updated:** 2025-11-10  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) have been widely adopted in recent large language models since it can efficiently scale up the model capability without increasing the inference cost. However, evaluations on broad downstream tasks reveal a consistent suboptimality of the routers in existing MoE LLMs, which results in a severe performance gap (e.g., 10-20% in accuracy) to the optimal routing. In thi...

**Authors:** Antonios Valkanas, Soumyasundar Pal, Pavel Rumiantsev et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-10  
**Updated:** 2025-11-10  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results on complex reasoning tasks, but their high inference cost remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. A promising solution is to use cascaded inference, where small, cheap models handle easy queries, and only the hardest examples are escalated to more powerful models. However, existing cascade methods typically rely on supervised ...

**Published:** 2025-11-10  
**Updated:** 2025-11-10  
**Categories:** cs.LG, q-bio.QM  

**Abstract:** Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to...

### [Classical gravity cannot mediate entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07348v1)

**Published:** 2025-11-10  
**Updated:** 2025-11-10  
**Categories:** quant-ph, gr-qc  

**Abstract:** In Nature, 646, 813 (2025), Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantised) gravity produces entanglement. We show that their model does not produce entanglement. Even if the model produced entanglement, it would be mediated by the quantised matter interaction, and not gravity. Hence entanglement mediated by gravity remains an unambiguous witness of gravity's quantum features.

**Abstract:** It is well known that a quantum walk in an ordered medium exhibits ballistic propagation. A related process is the driven quantum walk, in which the number of walkers varies over time. In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead exhibits two distinct transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive.
