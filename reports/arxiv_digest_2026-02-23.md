### [A Fine-Grained and Efficient Reliability Analysis Framework for Noisy Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18347v1)
**Authors:** Jindi Wu, Tianjie Hu, Qun Li  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Evaluating the reliability of noisy quantum circuits is essential for implementing quantum algorithms on noisy quantum devices. However, current quantum hardware exhibits diverse noise mechanisms whose compounded effects make accurate and efficient reliability evaluation challenging. While state fidelity is the most faithful indicator of circuit reliability, it is experimentally and computationall...

### [Unifying approach to uniform expressivity of graph neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18409v1)
**Authors:** Huan Luo, Jonni Virtema  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.LO  

**Abstract:** The expressive power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is often analysed via correspondence to the Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) algorithm and fragments of first-order logic. Standard GNNs are limited to performing aggregation over immediate neighbourhoods or over global read-outs. To increase their expressivity, recent attempts have been made to incorporate substructural information (e.g. cycle counts and ...

### [Theory and interpretability of Quantum Extreme Learning Machines: a Pauli-transfer matrix approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18377v1)
**Authors:** Markus Gross, Hans-Martin Rieser  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) have emerged as a promising approach to quantum machine learning, since they utilize the natural dynamics of quantum systems for data processing and are simple to train. Here, we consider n-qubit quantum extreme learning machines (QELMs) with continuous-time reservoir dynamics. QELMs are memoryless QRCs capable of various ML tasks, including image classification ...

### [Quantum stress and torsion distributions in the deuteron](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18298v1)
**Authors:** Wim Cosyn, Adam Freese, Alan Sosa  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** nucl-th, hep-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Stress distributions in the deuteron are related to form factors of the asymmetric energy-momentum tensor through three-dimensional Fourier transforms. There are eleven such form factors, which we calculate in an impulse approximation. We compare the obtained form factors to prior results for the six form factors that have been previously calculated. We then elaborate on the formalism for relating...

### [Qubit error bursts in superconducting quantum processors of Quantum Inspire: quasiparticle pumping and anomalous time dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18388v1)
**Authors:** G. R. Di Carlo, M. Samiotis, A. Kamlapure et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate qubit error bursts in 5- and 7-transmon processors of similar design, fabrication and packaging, but with different types of qubit Josephson junctions. Measurements for each are performed in two refrigerators to discern device-specific from refrigerator-dependent characteristics. The duration and rate of bursts are device specific but within the range of prior experiments and consis...

### [Towards scalable multi-qubit optimal control via interaction decomposition in the diagonal frame](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18375v1)
**Authors:** Bora Baran, Tommaso Calarco, Matthias M. Mueller et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In this work, we introduce a general n-qubit formulation of control objectives that allows a control target to be specified in a diagonal frame, so that only the diagonal entries must be characterized, thus quadratically reducing the complexity of the cost functional in constrast to a full target matrix. We do so by representing any n-qubit unitary transformation as a diagonal phase map on the com...

### [Improving Single Excitation Fidelity in Rydberg Superatoms for Efficient Single Photon Emission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18363v1)
**Authors:** Vidisha Aggarwal, Boxi Li, Eloisa Cuestas et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Deterministic single photon emission from a Rydberg ensemble coupled to an optical cavity requires high-fidelity preparation of collective single excitations. In such a setup imperfect Rydberg blockade can lead to unwanted double excitations, which degrade photon indistinguishability. In this work we adapt the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) technique, originally developed for supercon...

### [Universal Protection of Quantum States from Decoherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18327v1)
**Authors:** Francesco Atzori, Salvatore Virzì, Francesco Devecchi et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The fragility of quantum coherence fundamentally limits the scalability of quantum technologies, as unavoidable environmental interactions induce decoherence and rapidly degrade quantum properties. The Quantum Zeno Effect offers a powerful route to suppress quantum evolution and protect coherence through frequent measurements, irrespective of the underlying dynamics. However, existing implementati...

### [Impossibility of Refrigeration and Engine Operation in Minimal Qubit Repeated-Interaction Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18300v1)
**Authors:** Gabrielle Barsky-Giles, Alessandro Prositto, Matthew Gerry et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall  

**Abstract:** We investigate the operation of a qubit as a quantum thermal device within the repeated interaction framework, allowing for strong system-bath coupling and finite interaction times. We analyze two minimal models: an alternating-coupling setup, in which the qubit sequentially interacts with hot and cold baths, and a simultaneous-coupling setup, where both baths interact with the qubit during each c...

### [Assigning Confidence: K-partition Ensembles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18435v1)
**Authors:** Aggelos Semoglou, John Pavlopoulos  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Clustering is widely used for unsupervised structure discovery, yet it offers limited insight into how reliable each individual assignment is. Diagnostics, such as convergence behavior or objective values, may reflect global quality, but they do not indicate whether particular instances are assigned confidently, especially for initialization-sensitive algorithms like k-means. This assignment-level...

### [The Geometry of Noise: Why Diffusion Models Don't Need Noise Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18428v1)
**Authors:** Mojtaba Sahraee-Ardakan, Mauricio Delbracio, Peyman Milanfar  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV, eess.IV  

**Abstract:** Autonomous (noise-agnostic) generative models, such as Equilibrium Matching and blind diffusion, challenge the standard paradigm by learning a single, time-invariant vector field that operates without explicit noise-level conditioning. While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental pa...

### [Benchmarking Graph Neural Networks in Solving Hard Constraint Satisfaction Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18419v1)
**Authors:** Geri Skenderi, Lorenzo Buffoni, Francesco D'Amico et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly applied to hard optimization problems, often claiming superiority over classical heuristics. However, such claims risk being unsolid due to a lack of standard benchmarks on truly hard instances. From a statistical physics perspective, we propose new hard benchmarks based on random problems. We provide these benchmarks, along with performance results fr...

### [Subgroups of $U(d)$ Induce Natural RNN and Transformer Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18417v1)
**Authors:** Joshua Nunley  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** This paper presents a direct framework for sequence models with hidden states on closed subgroups of U(d). We use a minimal axiomatic setup and derive recurrent and transformer templates from a shared skeleton in which subgroup choice acts as a drop-in replacement for state space, tangent projection, and update map. We then specialize to O(d) and evaluate orthogonal-state RNN and transformer model...

### [Participation Ratio as a Quantum Probe of Hierarchical Stickiness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18412v1)
**Authors:** Ariel A. Galindo Duque, Miguel A. Prado Reynoso, Miguel Gonzalez et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, nlin.CD  

**Abstract:** We investigate how quantum localization encodes the hierarchical stickiness that governs transport in mixed classical phase spaces. Using the periodically driven kicked top, we show that the participation ratio (PR) of coherent states in the Floquet eigenbasis resolves the same layered structure that appears classically as a multimodal distribution of finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLEs). To est...

**Authors:** Minh Dinh, Stéphane Deny  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Despite the successes of deep learning in computer vision, difficulties persist in recognizing objects that have undergone group-symmetric transformations rarely seen during training-for example objects seen in unusual poses, scales, positions, or combinations thereof. Equivariant neural networks are a solution to the problem of generalizing across symmetric transformations, but require knowledge ...

**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Accurate prediction of main engine power is essential for vessel performance optimization, fuel efficiency, and compliance with emission regulations. Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to...

### [Leakage and Second-Order Dynamics Improve Hippocampal RNN Replay](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18401v1)
**Authors:** Josue Casco-Rodriguez, Nanda H. Krishna, Richard G. Baraniuk  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, q-bio.NC, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Biological neural networks (like the hippocampus) can internally generate "replay" resembling stimulus-driven activity. Recent computational models of replay use noisy recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained to path-integrate. Replay in these networks has been described as Langevin sampling, but new modifiers of noisy RNN replay have surpassed this description. We re-examine noisy RNN replay as s...

**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, eess.SP, math.PR, stat.AP, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We propose PRISM-FCP (Partial shaRing and robust calIbration with Statistical Margins for Federated Conformal Prediction), a Byzantine-resilient federated conformal prediction framework that utilizes partial model sharing to improve robustness against Byzantine attacks during both model training and conformal calibration. Existing approaches address adversarial behavior only in the calibration sta...

### [Learning to Tune Pure Pursuit in Autonomous Racing: Joint Lookahead and Steering-Gain Control with PPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18386v1)
**Authors:** Mohamed Elgouhary, Amr S. El-Wakeel  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG, eess.SY  

**Abstract:** Pure Pursuit (PP) is widely used in autonomous racing for real-time path tracking due to its efficiency and geometric clarity, yet performance is highly sensitive to how key parameters-lookahead distance and steering gain-are chosen. Standard velocity-based schedules adjust these only approximately and often fail to transfer across tracks and speed profiles. We propose a reinforcement-learning (RL...

### [FedZMG: Efficient Client-Side Optimization in Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18384v1)
**Authors:** Fotios Zantalis, Evangelos Zervas, Grigorios Koulouras  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) enables distributed model training on edge devices while preserving data privacy. However, clients tend to have non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data, which often leads to client-drift, and therefore diminishing convergence speed and model performance. While adaptive optimizers have been proposed to mitigate these effects, they frequently introduce comp...

### [Bell-GHZ nonclassicality of many-observer interwoven frustrated down conversions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18381v1)
**Authors:** Marek Żukowski, Paweł Cieśliński, Marcin Markiewicz et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Frustrated down conversion is a process in which a quantum superposition of emissions from two separate parametric down-conversion processes gives rise to observable interference. Depending on the phase relation between the probability amplitudes associated with emissions by the first and second crystal, the process can be enhanced or suppressed. This is achieved by aligning the setup so that the ...

**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** cs.IT, cs.LG, quant-ph, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Recent works have proposed various explanations for the ability of modern large language models (LLMs) to perform in-context prediction. We propose an alternative conceptual viewpoint from an information-geometric and statistical perspective. Motivated by Bach[2023], we model training as learning an embedding of probability distributions into the space of quantum density operators, and in-context ...

**Authors:** Goni Yoeli, Gilad Gour  
**Published:** 2026-02-20  
**Updated:** 2026-02-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We consolidate coherence, athermality, and nonuniformity as sub-resources within an underlying quantum resource theory: instability. We formulate instability axiomatically as the transient information within a decaying physical system. Specifying a decay mechanism (e.g., dephasing, thermalization) recovers these familiar resources as specific manifestations of instability. We compute the one-shot ...
