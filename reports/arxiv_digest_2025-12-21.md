### [Electric field diagnostics in a continuous rf plasma using Rydberg-EIT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16867v1)
**Authors:** Bineet Dash, Xinyan Xiang, Dingkun Feng et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-18  
**Updated:** 2025-12-18  
**Categories:** physics.atom-ph, physics.plasm-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a non-invasive spectroscopic technique to measure electric fields in plasma, leveraging large polarizabilities and Stark shifts of Rydberg atoms. Rydberg Stark shifts are measured with high precision using narrow-linewidth lasers via Electromagnetically Induced Transparency (EIT) of rubidium vapor seeded into a continuous, inductively coupled radio-frequency (rf) plasma in a few mTorr o...

These devices are a widely used tool for high-bandwidth random-access scanning applications, such as optical tweezers in quantum technology. A single AOD can generate multiple optical tweezers by multitone rf input in one d...

### [A magic criterion (almost) as nice as PPT, with applications in distillation and detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16777v1)
**Authors:** Zhenhuan Liu, Tobias Haug, Qi Ye et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-18  
**Updated:** 2025-12-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce a mixed-state magic criterion, the Triangle Criterion, which plays a role for magic analogous to the Positive Partial Transposition (PPT) criterion for entanglement: it combines strong detection capability, a clear geometric interpretation, and an operational link to magic distillation. Using this criterion, we uncover several new features of multi-qubit magic distillation and detecti...

### [Differences That Matter: Auditing Models for Capability Gap Discovery and Rectification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16921v1)
**Authors:** Qihao Liu, Chengzhi Mao, Yaojie Liu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-18  
**Updated:** 2025-12-18  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Conventional evaluation methods for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) lack interpretability and are often insufficient to fully disclose significant capability gaps across models. To address this, we introduce AuditDM, an automated framework that actively discovers and rectifies MLLM failure modes by auditing their divergence. AuditDM fine-tunes an MLLM as an auditor via reinforcement learning to generate c...

**Abstract:** Perceiving and reconstructing 3D scene geometry from visual inputs is crucial for autonomous driving. However, there still lacks a driving-targeted dense geometry perception model that can adapt to different scenarios and camera configurations. To bridge this gap, we propose a Driving Visual Geometry Transformer (DVGT), which reconstructs a global dense 3D point map from a sequence of unposed mult...

**Published:** 2025-12-18  
**Updated:** 2025-12-18  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We investigate the mechanisms that arise when transformers are trained to solve arithmetic on sequences where tokens are variables whose meaning is determined only through their interactions. While prior work has found that transformers develop geometric embeddings that mirror algebraic structure, those previous findings emerge from settings where arithmetic-valued tokens have fixed meanings. We d...

### [Fighting non-locality with non-locality: microcausality and boundary conditions in QED](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16898v1)
**Authors:** Philipp A. Hoehn, Josh Kirklin  
**Published:** 2025-12-18  
**Updated:** 2025-12-18  
**Categories:** hep-th, gr-qc, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In gauge theories, globally charged observables necessarily depend non-locally on the kinematical fields, with this dependence extending to the asymptotic boundary of spacetime. Despite this, we show that a subset of such observables can be consistently regarded as local to the bulk, in a manner that respects microcausality and leaves locality properties of uncharged observables untouched. A suffi...

**Updated:** 2025-12-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.str-el  

**Abstract:** Contextuality is arguably the fundamental property that makes quantum mechanics different from classical physics. It is responsible for quantum computational speedups in both magic-state-injection-based and measurement-based models of computation, and can be directly probed in a many-body setting by multiplayer nonlocal quantum games. Here, we discuss a family of games that can be won with certain...

**Abstract:** We study the problem of finding confidence ellipsoids for an arbitrary distribution in high dimensions. Given samples from a distribution $D$ and a confidence parameter $α$, the goal is to find the smallest volume ellipsoid $E$ which has probability mass $\Pr_{D}[E] \ge 1-α$. Ellipsoids are a highly expressive class of confidence sets as they can capture correlations in the distribution, and can a...

**Abstract:** We develop a novel framework to build quantum many-body scar states in bipartite systems characterized by perfect correlation between the Hamiltonians governing the two sides. By means of a Krylov construction, we build an interaction term which supports a tower of equally-spaced energy eigenstates. This gives rise to finite-time revivals whenever the system is initialized in a purification of a g...

**Abstract:** Accurately quantifying the thermodynamic work costs of quantum operations is essential for the continued development and optimisation of emerging quantum technologies. This present a significant challenge in regimes of rapid control within complex, non-equilibrium environments - conditions under which many contemporary quantum devices operate and conventional approximations break down. Here, we in...

**Abstract:** Data-processing is a desired property of classical and quantum divergences and information measures. In information theory, the contraction coefficient measures how much the distinguishability of quantum states decreases when they are transmitted through a quantum channel, establishing linear strong data-processing inequalities (SDPI). However, these linear SDPI are not always tight and can be imp...

### [Reconstruction of Quantum Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16775v1)
**Authors:** Nicolás Medina Sánchez, Borivoje Dakić  
**Published:** 2025-12-18  
**Updated:** 2025-12-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** One of the traditional ways of introducing bosons and fermions is through creation and annihilation algebras. Historically, these have been associated with emission and absorption processes at the quantum level and are characteristic of the language of second quantization. In this work, we formulate the transition from first to second quantization by taking quotients of the state spaces of disting...
