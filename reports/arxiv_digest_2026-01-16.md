### [Quantum solver for single-impurity Anderson models with particle-hole symmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10594v1)
**Authors:** Mariia Karabin, Tanvir Sohail, Dmytro Bykov et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci  

**Abstract:** Quantum embedding methods, such as dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), provide a powerful framework for investigating strongly correlated materials. A central computational bottleneck in DMFT is in solving the Anderson impurity model (AIM), whose exact solution is classically intractable for large bath sizes. In this work, we develop and benchmark a quantum-classical hybrid solver tailored for DMF...

### [DInf-Grid: A Neural Differential Equation Solver with Differentiable Feature Grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10715v1)
**Authors:** Navami Kairanda, Shanthika Naik, Marc Habermann et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We present a novel differentiable grid-based representation for efficiently solving differential equations (DEs). Widely used architectures for neural solvers, such as sinusoidal neural networks, are coordinate-based MLPs that are both computationally intensive and slow to train. Although grid-based alternatives for implicit representations (e.g., Instant-NGP and K-Planes) train faster by exploiti...

### [Efficiency, Curvature, and Complexity of Quantum Evolutions for Qubits in Nonstationary Magnetic Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10672v1)
**Authors:** Carlo Cafaro, James Schneeloch  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In optimal quantum-mechanical evolutions, motion can take place along paths of minimal length within an optimal time frame. Alternatively, optimal evolutions may occur along established paths without any waste of energy resources and achieving 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical scenarios often lead to less-than-ideal evolutions that demonstrate suboptimal efficiency, nonzero ...

### [Geometric Aspects of Entanglement Generating Hamiltonian Evolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10662v1)
**Authors:** Carlo Cafaro, James Schneeloch  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We examine the pertinent geometric characteristics of entanglement that arise from stationary Hamiltonian evolutions transitioning from separable to maximally entangled two-qubit quantum states. From a geometric perspective, each evolution is characterized by means of geodesic efficiency, speed efficiency, and curvature coefficient. Conversely, from the standpoint of entanglement, these evolutions...

**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The entanglement distance of evolutionary quantum states of a two-spin system with the XXZ model has been studied. The analysis has been conducted both analytically and using quantum computing. An analytical dependence of the entanglement distance on the values of the model coupling constants and the parameters of the initial states has been obtained. The speed of evolution of a two-spin system ha...

### [Quantum Maxwell Erasure Decoder for qLDPC codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10713v1)
**Authors:** Bruno Costa Alves Freire, François-Marie Le Régent, Anthony Leverrier  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.IT  

**Abstract:** We introduce a quantum Maxwell erasure decoder for CSS quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes that extends peeling with bounded guessing. Guesses are tracked symbolically and can be eliminated by restrictive checks, giving a tunable tradeoff between complexity and performance via a guessing budget: an unconstrained budget recovers Maximum-Likelihood (ML) performance, while a constant budge...

### [MatchTIR: Fine-Grained Supervision for Tool-Integrated Reasoning via Bipartite Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10712v1)
**Authors:** Changle Qu, Sunhao Dai, Hengyi Cai et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) empowers large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex tasks by interleaving reasoning steps with external tool interactions. However, existing reinforcement learning methods typically rely on outcome- or trajectory-level rewards, assigning uniform advantages to all steps within a trajectory. This coarse-grained credit assignment fails to distinguish effective tool...

### [High-accuracy and dimension-free sampling with diffusions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10708v1)
**Authors:** Khashayar Gatmiry, Sitan Chen, Adil Salim  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.ST  

**Abstract:** Diffusion models have shown remarkable empirical success in sampling from rich multi-modal distributions. Their inference relies on numerically solving a certain differential equation. This differential equation cannot be solved in closed form, and its resolution via discretization typically requires many small iterations to produce \emph{high-quality} samples.   More precisely, prior works have s...

### [See Less, Drive Better: Generalizable End-to-End Autonomous Driving via Foundation Models Stochastic Patch Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10707v1)
**Authors:** Amir Mallak, Erfan Aasi, Shiva Sreeram et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving show that policies trained on patch-aligned features extracted from foundation models generalize better to Out-of-Distribution (OOD). We hypothesize that due to the self-attention mechanism, each patch feature implicitly embeds/contains information from all other patches, represented in a different way and intensity, making these descriptors highly ...

### [Distributed Perceptron under Bounded Staleness, Partial Participation, and Noisy Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10705v1)
**Authors:** Keval Jain, Anant Raj, Saurav Prakash et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We study a semi-asynchronous client-server perceptron trained via iterative parameter mixing (IPM-style averaging): clients run local perceptron updates and a server forms a global model by aggregating the updates that arrive in each communication round. The setting captures three system effects in federated and distributed deployments: (i) stale updates due to delayed model delivery and delayed a...

### [Scalable Spin Squeezing in Power-Law Interacting XXZ Models with Disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10703v1)
**Authors:** Samuel E. Begg, Bishal K. Ghosh, Chong Zu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.quant-gas  

**Abstract:** While spin squeezing has been traditionally considered in all-to-all interacting models, recent works have shown that spin squeezing can occur in systems with power-law interactions, leading to direct testing in Rydberg atoms, trapped ions, ultracold atoms and nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. For the latter, Wu. et al. Nature 646 (2025) demonstrated that spin squeezing is heavily affected...

**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IR  

**Abstract:** Deploying large language models in long-horizon, goal-oriented interactions remains challenging because similar entities and facts recur under different latent goals and constraints, causing memory systems to retrieve context-mismatched evidence. We propose STITCH (Structured Intent Tracking in Contextual History), an agentic memory system that indexes each trajectory step with a structured retrie...

### [LIBERTy: A Causal Framework for Benchmarking Concept-Based Explanations of LLMs with Structural Counterfactuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10700v1)
**Authors:** Gilat Toker, Nitay Calderon, Ohad Amosy et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Concept-based explanations quantify how high-level concepts (e.g., gender or experience) influence model behavior, which is crucial for decision-makers in high-stakes domains. Recent work evaluates the faithfulness of such explanations by comparing them to reference causal effects estimated from counterfactuals. In practice, existing benchmarks rely on costly human-written counterfactuals that ser...

**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.other, math-ph  

**Abstract:** We exploit the variational and Hamiltonian structures of quantum hydrodynamics with spin to unfold the correlation and torque mechanisms accompanying spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in electronic motion. Using Hamilton's action principle for the Pauli equation, we isolate SOC-induced quantum forces that act on the orbital Madelung--Bohm trajectories and complement the usual force terms known to appear i...

**Authors:** Francisca Vasconcelos, Malvika Raj Joshi  
**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** Dicke states serve as a critical resource in quantum metrology, communication, and computation. However, unitary preparation of Dicke states is limited to logarithmic depth in standard circuit models and existing constant-depth protocols require measurement and feed-forward. In this work, we present the first unitary, constant-depth protocols for exact Dicke state preparation. We overcome the loga...

**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Modeling complex dynamical systems under varying conditions is computationally intensive, often rendering high-fidelity simulations intractable. Although reduced-order models (ROMs) offer a promising solution, current methods often struggle with stochastic dynamics and fail to quantify prediction uncertainty, limiting their utility in robust decision-making contexts. To address these challenges, w...

**Published:** 2026-01-15  
**Updated:** 2026-01-15  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Coupling mechanical motion to an optical resonator enables displacement measurements approaching the standard quantum limit (SQL). However, increasing the optomechanical coupling strength will inevitably lead to probing of the nonlinear response of the optical resonator. Thermal intermodulation noise (TIN) arising from the nonlinear mixing of thermomechanical motion can further increase the imprec...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.IT  

**Abstract:** Consider quantum channels with input dimension $d_1$, output dimension $d_2$ and Kraus rank at most $r$. Any such channel must satisfy the constraint $rd_2\geq d_1$, and the parameter regime $rd_2=d_1$ is called the boundary regime. In this paper, we show an optimal query lower bound $Ω(rd_1d_2/\varepsilon^2)$ for quantum channel tomography to within diamond norm error $\varepsilon$ in the away-fr...

**Abstract:** This work investigates the use of quantum resources in distributed storage systems. Consider an $(n,k,d)$ distributed storage system in which a file is stored across $n$ nodes such that any $k$ nodes suffice to reconstruct the file. When a node fails, any $d$ helper nodes transmit information to a newcomer to rebuild the system. In contrast to the classical repair, where helper nodes transmit clas...

**Abstract:** The Landau--Zener (LZ) model describes a two-level quantum system that undergoes an avoided crossing. In the adiabatic limit, the transition probability vanishes. An auxiliary control field $H_\text{CD}$ can be reverse-engineered so that the full Hamiltonian $H_0 + H_\text{CD}$ reproduces adiabaticity for all parameter values. Our aim is to construct a single control field $H_1$ that drives an ens...
