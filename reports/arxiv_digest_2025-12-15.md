### [Entanglement generation in qubit-ADAPT-VQE through four-qubit algebraic classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11729v1)
**Authors:** Diego Tancara, Herbert Díaz-Moraga, Vicente Sepúlveda-Trivelli et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-12  
**Updated:** 2025-12-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** While variational quantum algorithms are among the most promising approaches for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, their scalability is often hindered by the barren plateau problem. Among the proposals that have demonstrated robustness against this issue, the ADAPT-VQE algorithm stands out for ground state estimation, primarily due to its iterative ansatz construction. Although ADAP...

### [The Adaptive Vekua Cascade: A Differentiable Spectral-Analytic Solver for Physics-Informed Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11776v1)
**Authors:** Vladimer Khasia  
**Published:** 2025-12-12  
**Updated:** 2025-12-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Coordinate-based neural networks have emerged as a powerful tool for representing continuous physical fields, yet they face two fundamental pathologies: spectral bias, which hinders the learning of high-frequency dynamics, and the curse of dimensionality, which causes parameter explosion in discrete feature grids. We propose the Adaptive Vekua Cascade (AVC), a hybrid architecture that bridges deep...

Both Hermitian ($J_1 = J_2$) and non-Hermitian ($J_1 \neq J_2$) hopping regimes are analyzed. Within the framework of Floquet theory, the time-dependent Hamiltonian is mapped onto an effective static Floquet Hamiltonian, enabling a detailed study of the quasi-...

**Published:** 2025-12-12  
**Updated:** 2025-12-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum mechanics is the most successful theory to describe microscopic phenomena. It was derived in different ways over the past 100 years by Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and Feynman. At the same time, other interpretations have been suggested, including the Bohm-De Broglie interpretation and the so-called Bohmian mechanics. Here, we show that Bohmian mechanics, which utilizes the concept of the Bohm...
