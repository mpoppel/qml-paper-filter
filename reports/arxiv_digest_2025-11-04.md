### [FlowQ-Net: A Generative Framework for Automated Quantum Circuit Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26688v1)
**Authors:** Jun Dai, Michael Rizvi-Martel, Guillaume Rabusseau  
**Published:** 2025-10-30  
**Updated:** 2025-10-30  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce \textsc{FlowQ-Net}...

### [Quantum interference effects in two-photon scattering by a macroscopic lossy sphere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27612v1)
**Authors:** A. Ciattoni  
**Published:** 2025-10-31  
**Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate the quantum optical scattering of two-photon wavepackets by a macroscopic lossy sphere by means of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics in the form of modified Langevin noise formalism. The two ingoing photons with arbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two different directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering involves the three ...

### [Adaptive Context Length Optimization with Low-Frequency Truncation for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26389v1)
**Authors:** Wenchang Duan, Yaoliang Yu, Jiwan He et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-30

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.MA  

**Abstract:** Recently, deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has demonstrated promising performance for solving challenging tasks, such as long-term dependencies and non-Markovian environments. Its success is partly attributed to conditioning policies on large fixed context length. However, such large fixed context lengths may lead to limited exploration efficiency and redundant information. In this p...

**Published:** 2025-10-31  
**Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A promising platform for semi-device-independent quantum information is prepare-and-measure experiments restricted only by a bound on the energy of the communication.

**Published:** 2025-10-31  
**Updated:** 2025-11-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Entanglement entropy is a fundamental diagnostic for quantum chaos, typically exhibiting volume-law scaling in highly excited eigenstates of chaotic many-body systems. In this work, we present a striking counterexample: a Floquet-driven quantum many-body system with Rydberg-like blockade that, despite being fully chaotic as indicated by its Wigner-Dyson level statistics and local thermalization, e...

### [Continuous Autoregressive Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27688v1)
**Authors:** Chenze Shao, Darren Li, Fandong Meng et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-31  
**Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The efficiency of large language models (LLMs) is fundamentally limited by their sequential, token-by-token generation process. We argue that overcoming this bottleneck requires a new design axis for LLM scaling: increasing the semantic bandwidth of each generative step. To this end, we introduce Continuous Autoregressive Language Models (CALM), a paradigm shift from discrete next-token prediction...

**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph, math.MP  

**Abstract:** We propose a framework for quantum residual management, in which states discarded after a resource distillation process are repurposed as inputs for subsequent quantum information tasks. This approach extends conventional quantum resource theories by incorporating secondary resource extraction from residual states, thereby enhancing overall resource utility. As a concrete example, we investigate t...

We ...

**Published:** 2025-10-31  
**Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass (computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for cross-entropy loss and backprop...

**Abstract:** This paper studies optimization on networks modeled as metric graphs. Motivated by applications where the objective function is expensive to evaluate or only available as a black box, we develop Bayesian optimization algorithms that sequentially update a Gaussian process surrogate model of the objective to guide the acquisition of query points. To ensure that the surrogates are tailored to the net...

### [Panprediction: Optimal Predictions for Any Downstream Task and Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27638v1)
**Authors:** Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Nika Haghtalab, Daniel Hsu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-31  
**Updated:** 2025-10-31  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call panpredicti...

### [Visual Backdoor Attacks on MLLM Embodied Decision Making via Contrastive Trigger Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27623v1)
**Authors:** Qiusi Zhan, Hyeonjeong Ha, Rui Yang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-31

**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced embodied agents by enabling direct perception, reasoning, and planning task-oriented actions from visual inputs. However, such vision driven embodied agents open a new attack surface: visual backdoor attacks, where the agent behaves normally until a visual trigger appears in the scene, then persistently executes an attacker-specified multi-ste...

**Abstract:** Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high computational costs. To address...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum information tasks are often analyzed under varying trust assumptions about the devices involved. The semi-device-independent (SDI) framework offers a balance between needed assumptions and experimental feasibility. In this work, we study the energy-constrained SDI scenario, where the only assumption in a prepare-and-measure setup is an upper bound on the energy of the prepared quantum stat...

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly excelling and outpacing human performance on many tasks. However, to improve LLM reasoning, researchers either rely on ad-hoc generated datasets or formal mathematical proof systems such as the Lean proof assistant. Whilst ad-hoc generated methods can capture the decision chains of real-world reasoning processes, they may encode some inadvertent bias i...
