### [Rapid ground state energy estimation with a Sparse Pauli Dynamics-enabled Variational Double Bracket Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21651v1)
**Authors:** Chinmay Shrikhande, Arnab Bachhar, Aaron Rodriguez Jimenez et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26

**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.chem-ph, physics.comp-ph  

**Abstract:** Ground state energy estimation for strongly correlated quantum systems remains a central challenge in computational physics and chemistry. While tensor network methods like DMRG provide efficient solutions for one-dimensional systems, higher-dimensional problems remain difficult. Here we present a variational double bracket flow (vDBF) algorithm that leverages Sparse Pauli Dynamics, a technique or...

**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Versatile, tunable, and potentially scalable single-photon sources are a key asset in emergent photonic quantum technologies. In this work, a single-photon source based on WS$_2$ micro-domes, created via hydrogen ion irradiation, is realized and integrated into an open, tunable optical microcavity. Single-photon emission from the coupled emitter-cavity system is verified via the second-order corre...

### [Holographically Emergent Gauge Theory in Symmetric Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21685v1)
**Authors:** Akash Vijay, Jong Yeon Lee  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th  

**Abstract:** We develop a novel holographic framework for mixed-state phases in random quantum circuits, both unitary and non-unitary, with a global symmetry $G$. Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For uni...

### [FPGA-tailored algorithms for real-time decoding of quantum LDPC codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21660v1)
**Authors:** Satvik Maurya, Thilo Maurer, Markus Bühler et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Real-time decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing but likely requires specialized hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), whose parallelism can alter relative algorithmic performance. We analyze FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes: message passing, ordered statistics, and clustering. For message passin...

### [Revisiting Generalization Across Difficulty Levels: It's Not So Easy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21692v1)
**Authors:** Yeganeh Kordi, Nihal V. Nayak, Max Zuo et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We investigate how well large language models (LLMs) generalize across different task difficulties, a key question for effective data curation and evaluation. Existing research is mixed regarding whether training on easier or harder data leads to better results, and whether those gains come on easier or harder test data. We address this question by conducting a systematic evaluation of LLMs' gener...

### [TraceGen: World Modeling in 3D Trace Space Enables Learning from Cross-Embodiment Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21690v1)
**Authors:** Seungjae Lee, Yoonkyo Jung, Inkook Chun et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Learning new robot tasks on new platforms and in new scenes from only a handful of demonstrations remains challenging. While videos of other embodiments - humans and different robots - are abundant, differences in embodiment, camera, and environment hinder their direct use. We address the small-data problem by introducing a unifying, symbolic representation - a compact 3D "trace-space" of scene-le...

### [ToolOrchestra: Elevating Intelligence via Efficient Model and Tool Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21689v1)
**Authors:** Hongjin Su, Shizhe Diao, Ximing Lu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.MA  

**Abstract:** Large language models are powerful generalists, yet solving deep and complex problems such as those of the Humanity's Last Exam (HLE) remains both conceptually challenging and computationally expensive. We show that small orchestrators managing other models and a variety of tools can both push the upper bound of intelligence and improve efficiency in solving difficult agentic tasks. We introduce T...

### [G$^2$VLM: Geometry Grounded Vision Language Model with Unified 3D Reconstruction and Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21688v1)
**Authors:** Wenbo Hu, Jingli Lin, Yilin Long et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still lack robustness in spatial intelligence, demonstrating poor performance on spatial understanding and reasoning tasks. We attribute this gap to the absence of a visual geometry learning process capable of reconstructing 3D space from 2D images. We present G$^2$VLM, a geometry grounded vision-language model that bridges two fundamental aspects of spatial intellige...

### [Matrix: Peer-to-Peer Multi-Agent Synthetic Data Generation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21686v1)
**Authors:** Dong Wang, Yang Li, Ansong Ni et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Synthetic data has become increasingly important for training large language models, especially when real data is scarce, expensive, or privacy-sensitive. Many such generation tasks require coordinated multi-agent workflows, where specialized agents collaborate to produce data that is higher quality, more diverse, and structurally richer. However, existing frameworks for multi-agent synthesis ofte...

### [Agentic Learner with Grow-and-Refine Multimodal Semantic Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21678v1)
**Authors:** Weihao Bo, Shan Zhang, Yanpeng Sun et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** MLLMs exhibit strong reasoning on isolated queries, yet they operate de novo -- solving each problem independently and often repeating the same mistakes. Existing memory-augmented agents mainly store past trajectories for reuse. However, trajectory-based memory suffers from brevity bias, gradually losing essential domain knowledge. More critically, even in truly multimodal problem-solving settings...

### [On Evolution-Based Models for Experimentation Under Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21675v1)
**Authors:** Sadegh Shirani, Mohsen Bayati  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, cs.SI, econ.EM  

**Abstract:** Causal effect estimation in networked systems is central to data-driven decision making. In such settings, interventions on one unit can spill over to others, and in complex physical or social systems, the interaction pathways driving these interference structures remain largely unobserved. We argue that for identifying population-level causal effects, it is not necessary to recover the exact netw...

### [DSD: A Distributed Speculative Decoding Solution for Edge-Cloud Agile Large Model Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21669v1)
**Authors:** Fengze Yu, Leshu Li, Brad McDanel et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DC  

**Abstract:** Large language model (LLM) inference often suffers from high decoding latency and limited scalability across heterogeneous edge-cloud environments. Existing speculative decoding (SD) techniques accelerate token generation but remain confined to single-node execution. We propose DSD, a distributed speculative decoding framework that extends SD to multi-device deployments through coordinated draft-t...

### [Through the telecom lens: Are all training samples important?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21668v1)
**Authors:** Shruti Bothe, Illyyne Saffar, Aurelie Boisbunon et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The rise of AI in telecommunications, from optimizing Radio Access Networks to managing user experience, has sharply increased data volumes and training demands. Telecom data is often noisy, high-dimensional, costly to store, process, and label. Despite Ai's critical role, standard workflows still assume all training samples contribute equally. On the other hand, next generation systems require AI...

### [Escaping the Verifier: Learning to Reason via Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21667v1)
**Authors:** Locke Cai, Ivan Provilkov  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Training Large Language Models (LLMs) to reason often relies on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with task-specific verifiers. However, many real-world reasoning-intensive tasks lack verifiers, despite offering abundant expert demonstrations that remain under-utilized for reasoning-focused training. We introduce RARO (Relativistic Adversarial Reasoning Optimization) that learns strong reasoning capabil...

### [Finite Size Analysis of Decoy-State BB84 with Advantage Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21665v1)
**Authors:** Jonas Treplin, Philipp Kleinpaß, Davide Orsucci  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Advantage Distillation (AD) is a classical post-processing technique that enhances Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols by increasing the maximum acceptable Quantum Bit Error Rate (QBER) and thus extending the distance at which QKD links can be securely established. AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer high-fidelity bits, exhibiting a reduced QBER and thus lowering...

### [EvilGenie: A Reward Hacking Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21654v1)
**Authors:** Jonathan Gabor, Jayson Lynch, Jonathan Rosenfeld  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We introduce EvilGenie, a benchmark for reward hacking in programming settings. We source problems from LiveCodeBench and create an environment in which agents can easily reward hack, such as by hardcoding test cases or editing the testing files. We measure reward hacking in three ways: held out unit tests, LLM judges, and test file edit detection. We verify these methods against human review and ...

**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The proliferation of AI models in everyday devices has highlighted a critical challenge: prediction errors that degrade user experience. While existing solutions focus on error detection, they rarely provide efficient correction mechanisms, especially for resource-constrained devices. We present a novel system enabling users to correct AI misclassifications through few-shot learning, requiring min...

### [Factorisation conditions and causality for local measurements in QFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21644v1)
**Authors:** Robin Simmons, Maria Papageorgiou, Marios Christodoulou et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-th  

**Abstract:** Quantum operations that are perfectly admissible in non-relativistic quantum theory can enable signalling between spacelike separated regions when naively imported into quantum field theory (QFT). Prominent examples of such "impossible measurements", in the sense of Sorkin, include certain unitary kicks and projective measurements. It is generally accepted that only those quantum operations whose ...

### [Aligning LLMs Toward Multi-Turn Conversational Outcomes Using Iterative PPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21638v1)
**Authors:** Daniel R. Jiang, Jalaj Bhandari, Yukai Yang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Optimizing large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn conversational outcomes remains a significant challenge, especially in goal-oriented settings like AI marketing or sales agents who facilitate transactions via messaging platforms. The difficulty stems from sparse, long-horizon rewards and the discrepancy between response-level planning and token-level generation. In this technical note, we pr...

**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.AI, stat.AP, stat.CO, stat.ME, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** AI/ML models have rapidly gained prominence as innovations for solving previously unsolved problems and their unintended consequences from amplifying human biases. Advocates for responsible AI/ML have sought ways to draw on the richer causal models of system dynamics to better inform the development of responsible AI/ML. However, a major barrier to advancing this work is the difficulty of bringing...

### [Mechanisms of Non-Monotonic Scaling in Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21635v1)
**Authors:** Anantha Padmanaban Krishna Kumar  
**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Deeper Vision Transformers often perform worse than shallower ones, which challenges common scaling assumptions. Through a systematic empirical analysis of ViT-S, ViT-B, and ViT-L on ImageNet, we identify a consistent three-phase Cliff-Plateau-Climb pattern that governs how representations evolve with depth. We observe that better performance is associated with progressive marginalization of the [...

**Published:** 2025-11-26  
**Updated:** 2025-11-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Recent work by Freedman and Mulligan demonstrated that shallow multilayer perceptrons spontaneously develop Kolmogorov-Arnold geometric (KAG) structure during training on synthetic three-dimensional tasks. However, it remained unclear whether this phenomenon persists in realistic high-dimensional settings and what spatial properties this geometry exhibits.   We extend KAG analysis to MNIST digit c...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Algorithms have been estimated to increase AI training FLOP efficiency by a factor of 22,000 between 2012 and 2023 [Ho et al., 2024]. Running small-scale ablation experiments on key innovations from this time period, we are able to account for less than 10x of these gains. Surveying the broader literature, we estimate that additional innovations not included in our ablations account for less than ...
