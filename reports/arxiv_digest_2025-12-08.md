### [Consequences of Kernel Regularity for Bandit Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05957v1)
**Authors:** Madison Lee, Tara Javidi  
**Published:** 2025-12-05  
**Updated:** 2025-12-05  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** In this work we investigate the relationship between kernel regularity and algorithmic performance in the bandit optimization of RKHS functions. While reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods traditionally rely on global kernel regressors, it is also common to use a smoothness-based approach that exploits local approximations. We show that these perspectives are deeply connected through the...

### [Whatever Remains Must Be True: Filtering Drives Reasoning in LLMs, Shaping Diversity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05962v1)
**Authors:** Germán Kruszewski, Pierre Erbacher, Jos Rozen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-05  
**Updated:** 2025-12-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the de facto standard for tuning LLMs to solve tasks involving reasoning. However, growing evidence shows that models trained in such way often suffer from a significant loss in diversity. We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the "mode-seeking" or "zero-forcing" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on ...

**Abstract:** We introduce a simple post-training method that makes transformer attention sparse without sacrificing performance. Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 1B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\approx 0.3 \%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods de...

**Abstract:** We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-m...
