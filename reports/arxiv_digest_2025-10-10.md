**Categories:** cs.LG, cond-mat.dis-nn, physics.data-an, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Motivated by the growing interest in quantum machine learning, in particular quantum neural networks (QNNs), we study how recently introduced evaluation metrics based on the Fisher information matrix (FIM) are effective for predicting their training and prediction performance. We exploit the equivalence between a broad class of QNNs and Fourier models, and study the interplay between the \emph{eff...

### [Feature Identification via the Empirical NTK](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00468v2)
**Authors:** Jennifer Lin  
**Published:** 2025-10-01  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with ground-truth features. In...

**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** We present a new primitive for quantum algorithms that implements a discrete Hermite transform efficiently, in time that depends logarithmically in both the dimension and the inverse of the allowable error. This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm...

### [Equivalence of continuous- and discrete-variable gate-based quantum computers with finite energy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08546v1)
**Authors:** Alex Maltesson, Ludvig Rodung, Niklas Budinger et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We examine the ability of gate-based continuous-variable quantum computers to outperform qubit or discrete-variable quantum computers. Gate-based continuous-variable operations refer to operations constructed using a polynomial sequence of elementary gates from a specific finite set, i.e., those selected from the set of Gaussian operations and cubic phase gates. Our results show that for a fixed e...

**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** math.ST, cs.DS, cs.LG, math.PR, stat.TH  

**Abstract:** Recent work has generalized several results concerning the well-understood spiked Wigner matrix model of a low-rank signal matrix corrupted by additive i.i.d. Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance profile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a block structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm for detect...

The challenge of having up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to distinguish certai...

**Published:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** It is shown that every one-dimensional Hamiltonian with short-range interaction admits a quantum Gibbs sampler [CKG23] with a system-size independent spectral gap at all finite temperatures. Consequently, their Gibbs states can be prepared in polylogarithmic depth, and satisfy exponential clustering of correlations, generalizing [Ara69].

**Published:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed inductive bias. Our method combine...

**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters, and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to alternating bet...

**Published:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** A major drawback of adiabatic quantum computing (AQC) is fulfilling the energy gap constraint, which requires the total evolution time to scale inversely with the square of the minimum energy gap. Failure to satisfy this condition violates the adiabatic approximation, potentially undermining computational accuracy. Recently, several approaches have been proposed to circumvent this constraint. One ...

**Abstract:** We study coherence distillation under time-translation-invariant operations: given many copies of a quantum state containing coherence in the energy eigenbasis, the aim is to produce a purer coherent state while respecting the time-translation symmetry. This symmetry ensures that the output remains synchronized with the input and that the process can be realized by energy-conserving unitaries coup...

**Abstract:** We construct a neural network to perform regression on the local dark-matter density field given line-of-sight peculiar velocities of dark-matter halos, biased tracers of the dark matter field. Our architecture combines a convolutional U-Net with a point-cloud DeepSets. This combination enables efficient use of small-scale information and improves reconstruction quality relative to a U-Net-only ap...

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Neural networks are famously nonlinear. However, linearity is defined relative to a pair of vector spaces, $f$$:$$X$$\to$$Y$. Is it possible to identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich a linear operator $A$ betwee...

**Abstract:** How can we teach large multimodal models (LMMs) new skills without erasing prior abilities? We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. We observe that apparent "forgetting" on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a measurable shift i...

### [BlackboxNLP-2025 MIB Shared Task: Exploring Ensemble Strategies for Circuit Localization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06811v1)
**Authors:** Philipp Mondorf, Mingyang Wang, Sebastian Gerstner et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-08  
**Updated:** 2025-10-08  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The Circuit Localization track of the Mechanistic Interpretability Benchmark (MIB) evaluates methods for localizing circuits within large language models (LLMs), i.e., subnetworks responsible for specific task behaviors. In this work, we investigate whether ensembling two or more circuit localization methods can improve performance. We explore two variants: parallel and sequential ensembling. In p...

### [Fundamental Limits of Crystalline Equivariant Graph Neural Networks: A Circuit Complexity Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05494v1)
**Authors:** Yang Cao, Zhao Song, Jiahao Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-07  
**Updated:** 2025-10-07  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions. Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic, symmetry-constrained set...

### [Causal Abstractions, Categorically Unified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05033v1)
**Authors:** Markus Englberger, Devendra Singh Dhami  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We present a categorical framework for relating causal models that represent the same system at different levels of abstraction. We define a causal abstraction as natural transformations between appropriate Markov functors, which concisely consolidate desirable properties a causal abstraction should exhibit. Our approach unifies and generalizes previously considered causal abstractions, and we obt...

### [Dissecting Larval Zebrafish Hunting using Deep Reinforcement Learning Trained RNN Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03699v1)
**Authors:** Raaghav Malik, Satpreet H. Singh, Sonja Johnson-Yu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-04

**Categories:** q-bio.NC, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.NE, cs.SY, eess.SY, I.2.6; I.2.0; I.5.1  

**Abstract:** Larval zebrafish hunting provides a tractable setting to study how ecological and energetic constraints shape adaptive behavior in both biological brains and artificial agents. Here we develop a minimal agent-based model, training recurrent policies with deep reinforcement learning in a bout-based zebrafish simulator. Despite its simplicity, the model reproduces hallmark hunting behaviors -- inclu...
