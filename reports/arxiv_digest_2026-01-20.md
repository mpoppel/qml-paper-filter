### [Dressed-state relaxation in coupled qubits as a source of two-qubit gate errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11316v1)
**Authors:** Ruixia Wang, Jiayu Ding, Chenlu Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-16  
**Updated:** 2026-01-16  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Understanding error mechanisms in two-qubit gate operations is essential for building high-fidelity quantum processors. While prior studies predominantly treat dephasing noise as either Markovian or predominantly low-frequency, realistic qubit environments exhibit structured, frequency-dependent spectra. Here we demonstrate that noise at frequencies matching the dressed-state energy splitting--set...

### [On the Probability of First Success in Differential Evolution: Hazard Identities and Tail Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11499v1)
**Authors:** Dimitar Nedanovski, Svetoslav Nenov, Dimitar Pilev  
**Published:** 2026-01-16  
**Updated:** 2026-01-16  
**Categories:** cs.NE, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We study first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) through a conditional hazard frame work. Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\Prob(E_t\mid\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities f...
