**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A classical representation for quantum eigenstates of a particle bound in $\lambda z^{2m}$ $(\lambda >0, m=1,2,...)$ potentials is developed. It is represented by ensembles of classical trajectories with energy distributions that can take on negative values, for $m>1$ have integrable singularities at zero energy and whose mean energies coincide with quantum eigenenergies. The corresponding Schr\"o...

### [On Biologically Plausible Learning in Continuous Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808v1)
**Authors:** Marc Gong Bacvanski, Liu Ziyin, Tomaso Poggio  
**Published:** 2025-10-21  
**Updated:** 2025-10-21  
**Categories:** cs.LG, q-bio.NC  

**Abstract:** Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA...

**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-th  

**Abstract:** For chaotic quantum dynamics modeled by random unitary circuits, we study the complexity of reduced density matrices of subsystems as a function of evolution time where the initial global state is a product state. The state complexity is defined as the minimum number of local quantum channels to generate a given state from a product state to a good approximation. In $1+1$d, we prove that the compl...

**Abstract:** Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is not fully understood, and...

### [A Frequentist Statistical Introduction to Variational Inference, Autoencoders, and Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18777v1)
**Authors:** Yen-Chi Chen  
**Published:** 2025-10-21  
**Updated:** 2025-10-21  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, stat.CO, stat.ME  

**Abstract:** While Variational Inference (VI) is central to modern generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), its pedagogical treatment is split across disciplines. In statistics, VI is typically framed as a Bayesian method for posterior approximation. In machine learning, however, VAEs and DDMs are developed from a Frequentist viewpoint, where VI is used to a...

**Published:** 2025-10-19  
**Updated:** 2025-10-19  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time,...

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used across diverse cultural contexts, making accurate cultural understanding essential. Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultur...
