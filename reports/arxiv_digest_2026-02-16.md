### [Which Algorithms Can Graph Neural Networks Learn?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13106v1)
**Authors:** Solveig Wittig, Antonis Vasileiou, Robert R. Nerem et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.DS, cs.NE  

**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been growing interest in understanding neural architectures' ability to learn to execute discrete algorithms, a line of work often referred to as neural algorithmic reasoning. The goal is to integrate algorithmic reasoning capabilities into larger neural pipelines. Many such architectures are based on (message-passing) graph neural networks (MPNNs), owing to their permut...

### [Stronger Welch Bounds and Optimal Approximate $k$-Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13099v1)
**Authors:** Riccardo Castellano, Dmitry Grinko, Sadra Boreiri et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** A fundamental question asks how uniformly finite sets of pure quantum states can be distributed in a Hilbert space. The Welch bounds address this question, and are saturated by $k$-designs, i.e. sets of states reproducing the $k$-th Haar moments. However, these bounds quickly become uninformative when the number of states is below that required for an exact $k$-design. We derive strengthened Welch...

### [Single snapshot non-Markovianity of Pauli channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13145v1)
**Authors:** Alireza Seif, Moein Malekakhlagh, Swarnadeep Majumder Luke C. G. Govia  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Pauli channels are widely used to describe errors in quantum computers, particularly when noise is shaped via Pauli twirling. A common assumption is that such channels admit a Markovian generator, namely a Pauli-Lindblad model with non-negative rates, but the validity of this assumption has not been systematically examined. Here, using CP-indivisibility as our criterion for non-Markovianity, we st...

**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-sc...

### [Quantization-Robust LLM Unlearning via Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13151v1)
**Authors:** João Vitor Boer Abitante, Joana Meneguzzo Pasquali, Luan Fonseca Garcia et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Large Language Model (LLM) unlearning aims to remove targeted knowledge from a trained model, but practical deployments often require post-training quantization (PTQ) for efficient inference. However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter cha...

### [Non-chiral ephemeral edge states and cascading of exceptional points in the non-reciprocal Haldane model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13147v1)
**Authors:** Aditi A. Prabhudesai, H. S. Chhabra, Suraj S. Hegde  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study a variant of the Haldane honeycomb model that has non-reciprocal hoppings between the next-nearest neighbours. The system on a torus hosts time-reversal symmetry protected exceptional rings(ER) in the spectrum. The ERs act as Berry-curvature flux tubes i.e the Berry curvature is non-zero only inside the ERs. The system on a cylinder having zig-zag boundaries (and transverse momentum $k_x$...

### [Mean-Force Hamiltonians from Influence Functionals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13146v1)
**Authors:** Gerard McCaul  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Hamiltonian of mean force (HMF) provides the standard starting point for strong-coupling thermodynamics, yet explicit operator forms are known only in restricted settings. We present a quenched density framework that uses the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to rewrite the reduced equilibrium state as an average over local propagators in imaginary time. This approach rigorously separates th...

### [FlashSchNet: Fast and Accurate Coarse-Grained Neural Network Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13140v1)
**Authors:** Pingzhi Li, Hongxuan Li, Zirui Liu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CE  

**Abstract:** Graph neural network (GNN) potentials such as SchNet improve the accuracy and transferability of molecular dynamics (MD) simulation by learning many-body interactions, but remain slower than classical force fields due to fragmented kernels and memory-bound pipelines that underutilize GPUs. We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between...

### [Order Matters in Retrosynthesis: Structure-aware Generation via Reaction-Center-Guided Discrete Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13136v1)
**Authors:** Chenguang Wang, Zihan Zhou, Lei Bai et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Template-free retrosynthesis methods treat the task as black-box sequence generation, limiting learning efficiency, while semi-template approaches rely on rigid reaction libraries that constrain generalization. We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-...

### [Eventizing Traditionally Opaque Binary Neural Networks as 1-safe Petri net Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13128v1)
**Authors:** Mohamed Tarraf, Alex Chan, Alex Yakovlev et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) offer a low-complexity and energy-efficient alternative to traditional full-precision neural networks by constraining their weights and activations to binary values. However, their discrete, highly non-linear behavior makes them difficult to explain, validate and formally verify. As a result, BNNs remain largely opaque, limiting their suitability in safety-critical do...

**Published:** 2026-02-13  
**Updated:** 2026-02-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Self-play bootstraps LLM reasoning through an iterative Challenger-Solver loop: the Challenger is trained to generate questions that target the Solver's capabilities, and the Solver is optimized on the generated data to expand its reasoning skills. However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key f...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Deep learning has significantly improved time series classification, yet the lack of explainability in these models remains a major challenge. While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series int...

**Abstract:** We present an effective potential that allows quantum thermal expectation values of a position-dependent observable to be estimated as a classical ensemble average of the corresponding function. We follow the approach of Feynman and Hibbs, but perform the mean-field treatment of quantum fluctuations about the path starting point rather than the path centroid. Furthermore, rather than performing a ...
