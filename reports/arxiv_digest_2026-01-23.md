### [Domain-Incremental Continual Learning for Robust and Efficient Keyword Spotting in Resource Constrained Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16158v1)
**Authors:** Prakash Dhungana, Sayed Ahmad Salehi  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.SD, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Keyword Spotting (KWS) systems with small footprint models deployed on edge devices face significant accuracy and robustness challenges due to domain shifts caused by varying noise and recording conditions. To address this, we propose a comprehensive framework for continual learning designed to adapt to new domains while maintaining computational efficiency. The proposed pipeline integrates a dual...

### [Polynomial-time thermalization and Gibbs sampling from system-bath couplings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16154v1)
**Authors:** Samuel Slezak, Matteo Scandi, Álvaro M. Alhambra et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Many physical phenomena, including thermalization in open quantum systems and quantum Gibbs sampling, are modeled by Lindbladians approximating a system weakly coupled to a bath. Understanding the convergence speed of these Lindbladians to their steady states is crucial for bounding algorithmic runtimes and thermalization timescales. We study two such families of processes: one characterizing a re...

### [Robust Quantum Algorithmic Binary Decision-Making on Displacement Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16081v1)
**Authors:** Aishwarya Majumdar, Yuan Liu  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A relevant signal in the quantum domain may manifest as a displacement or a phase shift operator in the bosonic phase space. For a real parameter $β$ embedded in such a displacement operator, the task of determining if $β\in [β_{-th}, β_{+th}]$ for real asymmetric thresholds $(β_{-th} \ne -β_{+th})$ is a binary decision problem. We propose a framework based on generalized quantum signal processing...

### [Studying energy-resolved transport with wavepacket dynamics on quantum computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16180v1)
**Authors:** Melody Lee, Roland C. Farrell  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn  

**Abstract:** Probing energy-dependent transport in quantum simulators requires preparing states with tunable energy and small energy variance. Existing approaches often study quench dynamics of simple initial states, such as computational basis states, which are far from energy eigenstates and therefore limit the achievable energy resolution. In this work, we propose using wavepackets to probe transport proper...

**Authors:** Samuel Stein, Shuwen Kan, Chenxu Liu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Real-time decoding of quantum error correction (QEC) is essential for enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. A practical decoder must operate with high accuracy at low latency, while remaining robust to spatial and temporal variations in hardware noise. We introduce a hardware-conditioned neural decoder framework designed to exploit the natural separation of timescales in superconducting pro...

**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Prime factorization on quantum processors is typically implemented either via circuit-based approaches such as Shor's algorithm or through Hamiltonian optimization methods based on adiabatic, annealing, or variational techniques. While Shor's algorithm demands high-fidelity quantum gates, Hamiltonian optimization schemes, with prime factors encoded as degenerate ground states of a problem Hamilton...

### [Why Can't I Open My Drawer? Mitigating Object-Driven Shortcuts in Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16211v1)
**Authors:** Geo Ahn, Inwoong Lee, Taeoh Kim et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined fact...

### [PyraTok: Language-Aligned Pyramidal Tokenizer for Video Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16210v1)
**Authors:** Onkar Susladkar, Tushar Prakash, Adheesh Juvekar et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete lat...

### [LLM-in-Sandbox Elicits General Agentic Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16206v1)
**Authors:** Daixuan Cheng, Shaohan Huang, Yuxian Gu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We introduce LLM-in-Sandbox, enabling LLMs to explore within a code sandbox (i.e., a virtual computer), to elicit general intelligence in non-code domains. We first demonstrate that strong LLMs, without additional training, exhibit generalization capabilities to leverage the code sandbox for non-code tasks. For example, LLMs spontaneously access external resources to acquire new knowledge, leverag...

### [Counterfactual Training: Teaching Models Plausible and Actionable Explanations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16205v1)
**Authors:** Patrick Altmeyer, Aleksander Buszydlik, Arie van Deursen et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real...

**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong capabilities across diverse applications, yet remain vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that distort their feature representations and induce erroneous predictions. To address this vulnerability, we propose the Feature-space Smoothing (FS) and theoretically prove that FS offers certified robustness on the feature representations of MLLMs...

**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Bell tests based on homodyne detection are strongly constrained in continuous-variable systems. Can Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) encoding turn homodyne detection into a practical tool for revealing Bell nonlocality? We consider a physically motivated model in which each party performs homodyne detection and digitizes the continuous outcome via a fixed periodic binning, corresponding to logical ...

**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** Understanding how to analyze highly entangled thermal eigenstates is a central challenge in the study of quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we introduce a stabilizer-based approach to construct analytically tractable energy eigenstates of nonintegrable many-body Hamiltonians. Focusing on zero-energy eigenstates at infinite temperature, we prove a sharp no-go theorem: stabilizer eigenstates...

### [Learning to Discover at Test Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16175v1)
**Authors:** Mert Yuksekgonul, Daniel Koceja, Xinhao Li et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one gre...

### [Beyond Predictive Uncertainty: Reliable Representation Learning with Structural Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16174v1)
**Authors:** Yiyao Yang  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Uncertainty estimation in machine learning has traditionally focused on the prediction stage, aiming to quantify confidence in model outputs while treating learned representations as deterministic and reliable by default. In this work, we challenge this implicit assumption and argue that reliability should be regarded as a first-class property of learned representations themselves. We propose a pr...

**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the mi...

**Abstract:** Recent video generation models demonstrate remarkable ability to capture complex physical interactions and scene evolution over time. To leverage their spatiotemporal priors, robotics works have adapted video models for policy learning but introduce complexity by requiring multiple stages of post-training and new architectural components for action generation. In this work, we introduce Cosmos Pol...

### [On the structural properties of Lie algebras via associated labeled directed graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16161v1)
**Authors:** Tim Heib, David Edward Bruschi  
**Published:** 2026-01-22  
**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a method for associating labeled directed graphs to finite-dimensional Lie algebras, thereby enabling rapid identification of key structural algebraic features. To formalize this approach, we introduce the concept of graph-admissible Lie algebras and analyze properties of valid graphs given the antisymmetry property of the Lie bracket as well as the Jacobi identity. Based on these found...

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Obtaining labelled ECG data for developing supervised models is challenging. Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, ...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** In combinatorial optimization problems with degenerate ground states, fair sampling of degenerate solutions is essential. However, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) with a standard transverse-field mixer induces biases among degenerate states as circuit depth increases. Based on quantum-classical correspondence theory, we propose SBO-QAOA, which employs a temperature-dependent ...

**Abstract:** The problem of determining the (least) fixpoint of (higher-dimensional) functions over the non-negative reals frequently occurs when dealing with systems endowed with a quantitative semantics. We focus on the situation in which the functions of interest are not known precisely but can only be approximated. As a first contribution we generalize an iteration scheme called dampened Mann iteration, re...

**Updated:** 2026-01-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The manifold hypothesis suggests that the generalization performance of machine learning methods improves significantly when the intrinsic dimension of the input distribution's support is low. In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kern...

**Abstract:** The Arabic language has undergone notable transformations over time, including the emergence of new vocabulary, the obsolescence of others, and shifts in word usage. This evolution is evident in the distinction between the classical and modern Arabic eras. Although historians and linguists have partitioned Arabic literature into multiple eras, relatively little research has explored the automatic ...

**Abstract:** Computing the conditional mode of a distribution, better known as the $\mathit{maximum\ a\ posteriori}$ (MAP) assignment, is a fundamental task in probabilistic inference. However, MAP estimation is generally intractable, and remains hard even under many common structural constraints and approximation schemes. We introduce $\mathit{probably\ approximately\ correct}$ (PAC) algorithms for MAP infere...
