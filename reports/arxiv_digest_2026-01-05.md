### [Geometry of Reason: Spectral Signatures of Valid Mathematical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00791v1)
**Authors:** Valentin Noël  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LO  

**Abstract:** We present a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in large language models through spectral analysis of attention patterns. By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spec...

### [Qubits and Vacuum Amplitudes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00722v1)
**Authors:** Germán Rodrigo  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** hep-ph, hep-ex, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** High-energy colliders, such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, are genuine quantum machines, so, in line with Richard Feynman's original motivation for Quantum Computing, the scattering processes that take place there are natural candidates to be simulated on a quantum system. Potential applications range from quantum machine learning methods for collider data analysis, to faster and more...

### [The Ground State Energy of a Mean-Field Fermi Gas in Two Dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00750v1)
**Authors:** Gregorio Casadei, Sascha Lill  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** math-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We rigorously establish a formula for the correlation energy of a two-dimensional Fermi gas in the mean-field regime for potentials whose Fourier transform $\hat{V}$ satisfies $\hat{V}(\cdot) | \cdot | \in \ell^1$. Further, we establish the analogous upper bound for $\hat{V}(\cdot)^2 | \cdot |^{1 + \varepsilon} \in \ell^1$, which includes the Coulomb potential $\hat{V}(k) \sim |k|^{-2}$. The proof...

### [Training-Free Certified Bounds for Quantum Regression: A Scalable Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00745v1)
**Authors:** Demerson N. Gonçalves, Tharso D. Fernandes, Pedro H. G. Lugao et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a training-free, certified error bound for quantum regression derived directly from Pauli expectation values. Generalizing the heuristic of minimum accuracy from classification to regression, we evaluate axis-aligned predictors within the Pauli feature space. We formally prove that the optimal axis-aligned predictor constitutes a rigorous upper bound on the minimum training Mean Squared...

### [Geometric Complexity of Quantum Channels via Unitary Dilations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00735v1)
**Authors:** Alberto Acevedo, Antonio Falcó  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** Nielsen's geometric approach to quantum circuit complexity provides a Riemannian framework for quantifying the cost of implementing unitary (closed--system) dynamics. For open dynamics, however, the reduced evolution is described by quantum channels and admits many inequivalent Stinespring realizations, so any meaningful complexity notion must specify which microscopic resources are counted as acc...

**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** Quantum magic, quantified by nonstabilizerness, measures departures from stabilizer structure and underlies potential quantum speedups. We introduce an efficient classical algorithm that exactly computes stabilizer Rényi entropies and stabilizer nullity for generic many-body wavefunctions of $N$ qubits. The method combines the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform with an exact partition of Pauli operator...

**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Federated data sharing promises utility without centralizing raw data, yet existing embedding-level generators struggle under non-IID client heterogeneity and provide limited formal protection against gradient leakage. We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE back...

### [Categorical Reparameterization with Denoising Diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00781v1)
**Authors:** Samson Gourevitch, Alain Durmus, Eric Moulines et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Gradient-based optimization with categorical variables typically relies on score-function estimators, which are unbiased but noisy, or on continuous relaxations that replace the discrete distribution with a smooth surrogate admitting a pathwise (reparameterized) gradient, at the cost of optimizing a biased, temperature-dependent objective. In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by int...

**Abstract:** Let S be a set of states of a physical system and p(s) the probability of the occurrence of an event when the system is in state s in S. Such a function p from S to [0,1] is known as a numerical event or more accurately an S-probability. A set P of numerical events including the constant functions 0 and 1 and 1-p with every p in P becomes a poset when ordered by the order of real functions and can...

**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Evaluating off-ball defensive performance in football is challenging, as traditional metrics do not capture the nuanced coordinated movements that limit opponent action selection and success probabilities. Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help ext...

**Authors:** Max Ruiz Luyten, Mihaela van der Schaar  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art large language model (LLM) pipelines rely on bootstrapped reasoning loops: sampling diverse chains of thought and reinforcing the highest-scoring ones, mainly optimizing correctness. We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this fai...

**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Integrating symbolic constraints into deep learning models could make them more robust, interpretable, and data-efficient. Still, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task. Existing frameworks like DomiKnowS help this integration by providing a high-level declarative programming interface, but they still assume the user is proficient with the library's specific syntax. We propose AgenticDom...

### [Stochastic Actor-Critic: Mitigating Overestimation via Temporal Aleatoric Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00737v1)
**Authors:** Uğurcan Özalp  
**Published:** 2026-01-02  
**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, eess.SY  

**Abstract:** Off-policy actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning train a critic with temporal-difference updates and use it as a learning signal for the policy (actor). This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncert...

**Updated:** 2026-01-02  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.optics, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A defining quantity of a physical system is its energy which is represented by the Hamiltonian. In closed quantum mechanical or/and coherent wave-based systems the Hamiltonian is introduced as a Hermitian operator which ensures real energy spectrum and secures the decomposition of any state over a complete basis set spanning the space where the states live. Pseudo-Hermitian, or PT symmetric, syste...
