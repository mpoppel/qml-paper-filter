### [Reinforcement learning of quantum circuit architectures for molecular potential energy curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16559v1)
**Authors:** Maureen Krumtünger, Alissa Wilms, Paul K. Faehrmann et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum chemistry and optimization are two of the most prominent applications of quantum computers. Variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving problems in these domains. However, the design of the quantum circuit ansatz remains a challenge. Of particular interest is developing a method to generate circuits for any given instance of a problem, not merely a circuit tailored to a s...

### [Correction of chain losses in trapped ion quantum computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16632v1)
**Authors:** Nolan J. Coble, Min Ye, Nicolas Delfosse  
**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Neutral atom quantum computers and to a lesser extent trapped ions may suffer from atom loss. In this work, we investigate the impact of atom loss in long chains of trapped ions. Even though this is a relatively rare event, ion loss in long chains must be addressed because it destabilizes the entire chain resulting in the loss of all the qubits of the chain. We propose a solution to the chain loss...

**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall  

**Abstract:** We present a detailed analysis of slowly driven quantum thermal machines based on interacting qubits within the framework of the Lindblad master equation. By implementing a systematic expansion in the driving rate, we derive explicit expressions for the rate of work of the driving forces, the heat currents exchanged with the reservoirs, and the entropy production up to second order, ensuring full ...

### [Simulating Gaussian boson sampling on graphs in polynomial time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16558v1)
**Authors:** Konrad Anand, Zongchen Chen, Mary Cryan et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.DS  

**Abstract:** We show that a distribution related to Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) on graphs can be sampled classically in polynomial time. Graphical applications of GBS typically sample from this distribution, and thus quantum algorithms do not provide exponential speedup for these applications. We also show that another distribution related to Boson sampling can be sampled classically in polynomial time.

**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum asymmetry and coherence are genuinely quantum resources that are essential to realize quantum advantage in information technologies. However, all quantum processes are fundamentally constrained by quantum speed limits, which raises the question on the corresponding bounds on the rate of consumption of asymmetry and coherence. In the present work, we derive a formulation of the quantum spee...

**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The task of dataset distillation aims to find a small set of synthetic images such that training a model on them reproduces the performance of the same model trained on a much larger dataset of real samples. Existing distillation methods focus on synthesizing datasets that enable training randomly initialized models. In contrast, state-of-the-art vision approaches are increasingly building on larg...

### [Thinking-while-Generating: Interleaving Textual Reasoning throughout Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16671v1)
**Authors:** Ziyu Guo, Renrui Zhang, Hongyu Li et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Recent advances in visual generation have increasingly explored the integration of reasoning capabilities. They incorporate textual reasoning, i.e., think, either before (as pre-planning) or after (as post-refinement) the generation process, yet they lack on-the-fly multimodal interaction during the generation itself. In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the fi...

**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Unstructured pruning remains a powerful strategy for compressing deep neural networks, yet it often demands iterative train-prune-retrain cycles, resulting in significant computational overhead. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD ...

### [Faster Certified Symmetry Breaking Using Orders With Auxiliary Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16637v1)
**Authors:** Markus Anders, Bart Bogaerts, Benjamin Bogø et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** cs.LO, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Symmetry breaking is a crucial technique in modern combinatorial solving, but it is difficult to be sure it is implemented correctly. The most successful approach to deal with bugs is to make solvers certifying, so that they output not just a solution, but also a mathematical proof of correctness in a standard format, which can then be checked by a formally verified checker. This requires justifyi...

### [Non-Abelian operator size distribution in charge-conserving many-body systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16634v1)
**Authors:** Mina Tarakemeh, Shenglong Xu  
**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We show that operator dynamics in U(1) symmetric systems are constrained by two independent conserved charges and construct a non-Abelian operator size basis that respects both, enabling a symmetry-resolved characterization of operator growth. The non-Abelian operator size depends on the operator's nonlocal structure and is organized by an SU(2) algebra. Operators associated with large total angul...

**Abstract:** Policy gradient methods, which have been extensively studied in the last decade, offer an effective and efficient framework for reinforcement learning problems. However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework tha...

**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** This brief note clarifies that, in Generator Matching (which subsumes a large family of flow matching and diffusion models over continuous, manifold, and discrete spaces), both the Bregman divergence loss and the linear parameterization of the generator can depend on both the current state $X_t$ and the time $t$, and we show that the expectation over time in the loss can be taken with respect to a...

**Published:** 2025-11-20  
**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show strong potential as judges. However, existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off: adapting MLLMs to output a single score misaligns with the generative nature of MLLMs and limits fine-grained requirement understanding, whereas autoregressively generating judging analyses is prohibitively slow in high-throughput settings. Observing that judgment re...

**Abstract:** Palpation, the use of touch in medical examination, is almost exclusively performed by humans. We investigate a proof of concept for an artificial palpation method based on self-supervised learning. Our key idea is that an encoder-decoder framework can learn a $\textit{representation}$ from a sequence of tactile measurements that contains all the relevant information about the palpated object. We ...

**Abstract:** Case-based reasoning networks are machine-learning models that make predictions based on similarity between the input and prototypical parts of training samples, called prototypes. Such models are able to explain each decision by pointing to the prototypes that contributed the most to the final outcome. As the explanation is a core part of the prediction, they are often qualified as ``interpretabl...

**Updated:** 2025-11-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Two-mode squeezing is central to entangled-photon generation and nonlinear interferometry, yet standard perturbative low-gain and Gaussian treatments obscure how photon-number amplitudes interfere, especially in multi-crystal geometries and at high gain. Here, we derive the exact analytic action of the two-mode squeezing operator on arbitrary Fock states to analyze nonlinear interferometers direct...

The authors report that DQPTs persist even after averaging over the noise and they use their results to derive dynamical phase diagrams. In this comment we rigorously prove that in any two-dimension...
