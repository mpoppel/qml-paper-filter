### [Network Operations Scheduling for Distributed Quantum Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13687v1)
**Authors:** Nitish Kumar Chandra, Eneet Kaur, Kaushik P. Seshadreesan  
**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Realizing distributed architectures for quantum computing is crucial to scaling up computational power. A key component of such architectures is a scheduler that coordinates operations over a short-range quantum network required to enable the necessary non-local entangling gates between quantum processing units (QPUs). It is desirable to determine schedules of minimum make span, which in the case ...

**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat, hep-ph, hep-th  

**Abstract:** We construct two quantum error correction codes for pure SU(2) lattice gauge theory in the electric basis truncated at the electric flux $j_{\rm max}=1/2$, which are applicable on quasi-1D plaquette chains, 2D honeycomb and 3D triamond and hyperhoneycomb lattices. The first code converts Gauss's law at each vertex into a stabilizer while the second only uses half vertices and is locally the carbon...

**Authors:** Boldizsár Poór, Benjamin Rodatz, Aleks Kissinger  
**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We establish a new performance benchmark for the fault-tolerant syndrome extraction of [[7, 1, 3]] Steane code with a dynamic protocol. Our method is built on two highly optimized circuits derived using fault-equivalent ZX-rewrites: a primary fault-tolerant circuit with 14 CNOTs and an efficient non-fault-tolerant recovery circuit with 11 CNOTs. The protocol uses an adaptive response to internal f...

### [UnSAMv2: Self-Supervised Learning Enables Segment Anything at Any Granularity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13714v1)
**Authors:** Junwei Yu, Trevor Darrell, XuDong Wang  
**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The Segment Anything Model (SAM) family has become a widely adopted vision foundation model, but its ability to control segmentation granularity remains limited. Users often need to refine results manually - by adding more prompts or selecting from pre-generated masks - to achieve the desired level of detail. This process can be ambiguous, as the same prompt may correspond to several plausible mas...

### [From Power to Precision: Learning Fine-grained Dexterity for Multi-fingered Robotic Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13710v1)
**Authors:** Jianglong Ye, Lai Wei, Guangqi Jiang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Human grasps can be roughly categorized into two types: power grasps and precision grasps. Precision grasping enables tool use and is believed to have influenced human evolution. Today's multi-fingered robotic hands are effective in power grasps, but for tasks requiring precision, parallel grippers are still more widely adopted. This contrast highlights a key limitation in current robotic hand des...

### [Efficient Calibration for Decision Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13699v1)
**Authors:** Parikshit Gopalan, Konstantinos Stavropoulos, Kunal Talwar et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DS, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** A decision-theoretic characterization of perfect calibration is that an agent seeking to minimize a proper loss in expectation cannot improve their outcome by post-processing a perfectly calibrated predictor. Hu and Wu (FOCS'24) use this to define an approximate calibration measure called calibration decision loss ($\mathsf{CDL}$), which measures the maximal improvement achievable by any post-proc...

### [Quantum Advantage in Learning Mixed Unitary Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13683v1)
**Authors:** Yue Tu, Liang Jiang  
**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** We study the task of learning mixed unitary channels using Fisher information, under different quantum resource assumptions including ancilla and concatenation. Our result shows that the asymptotic sample complexity scales as $\frac{r}{d\varepsilon^2}$, where $r$ is the rank of the channel (i.e.\ the number of different unitaries), $d$ is the dimension of the system, and $\varepsilon^2$ is the mea...

### [Cross-Learning from Scarce Data via Multi-Task Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13680v1)
**Authors:** Leopoldo Agorio, Juan Cerviño, Miguel Calvo-Fullana et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, eess.SP  

**Abstract:** A learning task, understood as the problem of fitting a parametric model from supervised data, fundamentally requires the dataset to be large enough to be representative of the underlying distribution of the source. When data is limited, the learned models fail generalize to cases not seen during training. This paper introduces a multi-task \emph{cross-learning} framework to overcome data scarcity...

**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** cs.AR, cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Deformable transformers deliver state-of-the-art detection but map poorly to hardware due to irregular memory access and low arithmetic intensity. We introduce QUILL, a schedule-aware accelerator that turns deformable attention into cache-friendly, single-pass work. At its core, Distance-based Out-of-Order Querying (DOOQ) orders queries by spatial proximity; the look-ahead drives a region prefetch...

**Published:** 2025-11-17  
**Updated:** 2025-11-17  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Finding human-understandable circuits in language models is a central goal of the field of mechanistic interpretability. We train models to have more understandable circuits by constraining most of their weights to be zeros, so that each neuron only has a few connections. To recover fine-grained circuits underlying each of several hand-crafted tasks, we prune the models to isolate the part respons...

**Abstract:** We introduce a three-stroke quantum isochoric cycle that functions as a heat engine operating between two thermal reservoirs. Implemented for a particle confined in a one-dimensional infinite potential well, the cycle's performance is benchmarked against the classical three-stroke triangular and isochoric engines. We find that the quantum isochoric cycle achieves a higher efficiency than both clas...

**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** The random nature of spontaneous emission leads to unavoidable fluctuations in a laser's output. This is often included through random Langevin forces in laser rate equations, but this approach falls short for nanolasers. In this paper, we show that the laser quantum noise can be quantitatively computed for a very broad class of lasers by starting from simple and intuitive rate equations and merel...
