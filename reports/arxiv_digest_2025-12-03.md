### [Combinatorial foundations for solvable chaotic local Euclidean quantum circuits in two dimensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03029v1)
**Authors:** Fredy Yip  
**Published:** 2025-12-02  
**Updated:** 2025-12-02  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math.CO, math.MG  

**Abstract:** We investigate a graph-theoretic problem motivated by questions in quantum computing concerning the propagation of information in quantum circuits. A graph $G$ is said to be a bounded extension of its subgraph $L$ if they share the same vertex set, and the graph distance $d_L(u, v)$ is uniformly bounded for edges $uv\in G$. Given vertices $u, v$ in $G$ and an integer $k$, the geodesic slice $S(u, ...

### [Information dynamics and symmetry breaking in generic monitored $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric open quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03031v1)
**Authors:** Jacob Hauser, Ali Lavasani, Sagar Vijay et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-02  
**Updated:** 2025-12-02  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.str-el  

**Abstract:** We investigate the steady-state phases of generic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric monitored, open quantum dynamics. We describe the phases systematically in terms of both information-theoretic diagnostics and spontaneous breaking of strong and weak symmetries of the dynamics. We find a completely broken phase where information is retained by the quantum system, a strong-to-weak broken phase where informa...

Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end b...

### [Entanglement evolution from entangled multipodal states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03032v1)
**Authors:** Konstantinos Chalas, Pasquale Calabrese, Colin Rylands  
**Published:** 2025-12-02  
**Updated:** 2025-12-02  
**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In a periodic lattice system an entangled antipodal pair state, otherwise known as a crosscap state, is a simple two site product state in which spins at antipodal sites are prepared in Bell pairs. Such states have maximal bipartite entanglement and serve as a useful platform for studying the quench dynamics of systems which have large initial entanglement. In this paper, we study a generalization...

### [Many-body $k$-local ground states as probes for unitary quantum metrology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02976v1)
**Authors:** Majid Hassani, Mengyao Hu, Guillem Müller-Rigat et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-02  
**Updated:** 2025-12-02  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Multipartite quantum states saturating the Heisenberg limit of sensitivity typically require full-body correlators to be prepared. On the other hand, experimentally practical Hamiltonians often involve few-body correlators only. Here, we study the metrological performances under this constraint, using tools derived from the quantum Fisher information. Our work applies to any encoding generator, al...
