### [Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23470v1)
**Authors:** Jorge E. Pérez-García, Carlos Colchero, Julio C. Gutiérrez-Vega  
**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** An accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and control of open quantum systems. In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained u...

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Developing robust world model reasoning is crucial for large language model (LLM) agents to plan and interact in complex environments. While multi-turn interaction offers a superior understanding of environmental dynamics via authentic feedback, current approaches often impose a rigid reasoning process, which constrains the model's active learning, ultimately hindering efficient world model reason...

### [Provable Benefits of Sinusoidal Activation for Modular Addition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23443v1)
**Authors:** Tianlong Huang, Zhiyuan Li  
**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** This paper studies the role of activation functions in learning modular addition with two-layer neural networks. We first establish a sharp expressivity gap: sine MLPs admit width-$2$ exact realizations for any fixed length $m$ and, with bias, width-$2$ exact realizations uniformly over all lengths. In contrast, the width of ReLU networks must scale linearly with $m$ to interpolate, and they canno...

However, executing quantum algorithms across distributed systems requires careful co-design of algorithmic primitives and hardware architectures to manage circuit depth and entanglement overhead. We ide...

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We examine the complementarity among coherence (visibility), predictability, and entanglement for qubit and qutrit systems subjected to noisy quantum channels. Using the system-path entanglement framework, analytical expressions for all three quantities are derived for two- and three-slit interferometric setups. The study first establishes the validity of the triality relation in ideal conditions ...

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled breakthroughs in mathematical discovery, exemplified by AlphaEvolve, a closed-source system that evolves programs to improve bounds on open problems. However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an op...

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Current world models lack a unified and controlled setting for systematic evaluation, making it difficult to assess whether they truly capture the underlying rules that govern environment dynamics. In this work, we address this open challenge by introducing the SmallWorld Benchmark, a testbed designed to assess world model capability under isolated and precisely controlled dynamics without relying...

### [The Price of Progress: Algorithmic Efficiency and the Falling Cost of AI Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23455v1)
**Authors:** Hans Gundlach, Jayson Lynch, Matthias Mertens et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY  

**Abstract:** Language models have seen enormous progress on advanced benchmarks in recent years, but much of this progress has only been possible by using more costly models. Benchmarks may therefore present a warped picture of progress in practical capabilities per dollar. To remedy this, we use data from Artificial Analysis and Epoch AI to form the largest dataset of current and historical prices to run benc...

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.other, math-ph  

**Abstract:** The recently introduced random purification channel, which converts $n$ i.i.d. copies of any mixed quantum state into a uniform convex combination of $n$ i.i.d. copies of its purifications, has proved to be an extremely useful tool in quantum learning theory. Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparen...

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC, cs.LO, math.CO  

**Abstract:** We introduce the concept of quantum polymorphisms to the complexity theory of non-local games. We use this notion to give a full characterisation of the existence of commutativity gadgets for relational structures, introduced by Ji as a method for achieving quantum soundness of classical CSP reductions. Prior to our work, a classification was only known in the Boolean case [Culf--Mastel, STOC'25]....

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AR, cs.DC, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Machine learning models perform well across domains such as diagnostics, weather forecasting, NLP, and autonomous driving, but their limited uncertainty handling restricts use in safety-critical settings. Traditional neural networks often fail to detect out-of-domain (OOD) data and may output confident yet incorrect predictions. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) address this by providing probabilist...

### [A Heuristic for Matrix Product State Simulation of Out-of-Equilibrium Dynamics of Two-Dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23438v1)
**Authors:** Salvatore Mandrà, Nikita Astrakhantsev, Sergei Isakov et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Out-of-equilibrium dynamics of non-integrable Hamiltonian many-body quantum systems are characterized by highly entangled wave functions. Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resourc...

Here, we propose to exploit the collectively enhanced output field of a driven-dissipative many-body open quantum system as a light source in order to improve the precision of estimating optical phases. Pronounced temporal correlations of such o...

### [Quantum Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication With Degree Tables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23406v1)
**Authors:** Mohamed Nomeir, Alptug Aytekin, Lei Hu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.IT, cs.CR, cs.NI, eess.SP, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore how quantum resources can be used to increase the rate of private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM). In PDMM, a user who has two high-dimensional matrices, $A$ and $B$, and lacks the computational capabilities to apply matrix multiplication locally, divides the matrices $A$ and $B$ into $K$ and $L$ sub-blocks, respectively. Then, the user sends them to $N$ servers ...

**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Split learning is well known as a method for resolving data privacy concerns by training a model on distributed devices, thereby avoiding data sharing that raises privacy issues. However, high network communication costs are always an impediment to split learning, especially for large foundation models that require transmitting large amounts of high-dimensional data. To resolve this issue, we pres...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, nlin.CG  

**Abstract:** We present an exact renormalisation scheme for fermionic cellular automata on hypercubic lattices. By grouping neighbouring cells into tiles and selecting subspaces within them, multiple evolution steps on the original system correspond to a single step of an effective automaton acting on the subspaces. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalisability and fully characterise the...

### [Hilbert space fragmentation in driven-dephasing Rydberg atom array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23395v1)
**Authors:** Tianyi Yan, Chun Hei Leung, Weibin Li  
**Published:** 2025-11-28  
**Updated:** 2025-11-28  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, physics.atom-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate the onset and mechanism of Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF) in a chain of strongly interacting Rydberg atoms subject to local dephasing. It is found that the emergence of multiple long-lived metastable states is fundamentally tied to HSF of the driven-dephasing Rydberg atom system. We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple d...

**Abstract:** Pauli's exclusion principle forces fermions to occupy distinct quantum states, creating a filled region of momentum space at low temperature, the Fermi sea, whose topology governs the system's response to perturbations and the nature of its correlation functions. Recent theory predicts that for non-interacting fermions, the Euler characteristic of a $D$-dimensional Fermi sea -- the topological inv...
