### [A Unified Frequency Principle for Quantum and Classical Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03169v1)
**Authors:** Rundi Lu, Ruiqi Zhang, Weikang Li et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum neural networks constitute a key class of near-term quantum learning models, yet their training dynamics remain not fully understood. Here, we present a unified theoretical framework for the frequency principle (F-principle) that characterizes the training dynamics of both classical and quantum neural networks. Within this framework, we prove that quantum neural networks exhibit a spectral...

### [Shallow-circuit Supervised Learning on a Quantum Processor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03235v1)
**Authors:** Luca Candelori, Swarnadeep Majumder, Antonio Mezzacapo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Quantum computing has long promised transformative advances in data analysis, yet practical quantum machine learning has remained elusive due to fundamental obstacles such as a steep quantum cost for the loading of classical data and poor trainability of many quantum machine learning algorithms designed for near-term quantum hardware. In this work, we show that one can overcome these obstacles by ...

### [On the Convergence Behavior of Preconditioned Gradient Descent Toward the Rich Learning Regime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03162v1)
**Authors:** Shuai Jiang, Alexey Voronin, Eric Cyr et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low frequencies first, can be both a blessing and a curse. While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networ...

### [$\mathsf{QAC}^0$ Contains $\mathsf{TC}^0$ (with Many Copies of the Input)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03243v1)
**Authors:** Daniel Grier, Jackson Morris, Kewen Wu  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.CC, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** $\mathsf{QAC}^0$ is the class of constant-depth polynomial-size quantum circuits constructed from arbitrary single-qubit gates and generalized Toffoli gates. It is arguably the smallest natural class of constant-depth quantum computation which has not been shown useful for computing any non-trivial Boolean function. Despite this, many attempts to port classical $\mathsf{AC}^0$ lower bounds to $\ma...

### [Gradient descent reliably finds depth- and gate-optimal circuits for generic unitaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03123v1)
**Authors:** Janani Gomathi, Alex Meiburg  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** When the gate set has continuous parameters, synthesizing a unitary operator as a quantum circuit is always possible using exact methods, but finding minimal circuits efficiently remains a challenging problem. The landscape is very different for compiled unitaries, which arise from programming and typically have short circuits, as compared with generic unitaries, which use all parameters and typic...

### [Grand-Canonical Typicality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03253v1)
**Authors:** Cedric Igelspacher, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study how the grand-canonical density matrix arises in macroscopic quantum systems. ``Canonical typicality'' is the known statement that for a typical wave function $Ψ$ from a micro-canonical energy shell of a quantum system $S$ weakly coupled to a large but finite quantum system $B$, the reduced density matrix $\hatρ^S_Ψ=\mathrm{tr}^B |Ψ\rangle\langle Ψ|$ is approximately equal to the canonica...

**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, eess.IV  

**Abstract:** Many important problems in science and engineering involve inferring a signal from noisy and/or incomplete observations, where the observation process is known. Historically, this problem has been tackled using hand-crafted regularization (e.g., sparsity, total-variation) to obtain meaningful estimates. Recent data-driven methods often offer better solutions by directly learning a solver from exam...

### [Restoring Bloch's Theorem for Cavity Exciton Polaron-Polaritons](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03230v1)
**Authors:** Michael A. D. Taylor, Yu Zhang  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.other, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We introduce a symmetry-informed representation for hybrid photon--exciton--phonon quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonians to restore Bloch's theorem. The interchange of momenta between fermions and bosons breaks crystalline excitons' translational symmetry under strong coupling. Restoring said symmetry, we efficiently compute experimentally accessible observables without introducing approximations t...

**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.SD, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Geo-localization aims to infer the geographic origin of a given signal. In computer vision, geo-localization has served as a demanding benchmark for compositional reasoning and is relevant to public safety. In contrast, progress on audio geo-localization has been constrained by the lack of high-quality audio-location pairs. To address this gap, we introduce AGL1K, the first audio geo-localization ...

**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Can we learn more from data than existed in the generating process itself? Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume o...

### [When does entanglement through gravity imply gravitons?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03214v1)
**Authors:** Nikolaos Mitrakos, Maria Papageorgiou, T. Rick Perche et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** gr-qc, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Detection of entanglement through the Newtonian potential has been claimed to support the existence of gravitons, by extrapolating to a thought experiment which demonstrates that complementarity and causality would be in conflict unless quantum fluctuations exist. We critically assess this consistency argument using scalar field models. We show that whether complementarity or no-signalling is viol...

**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a gener...

**Categories:** cs.IR, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** In enterprise search, building high-quality datasets at scale remains a central challenge due to the difficulty of acquiring labeled data. To resolve this challenge, we propose an efficient approach to fine-tune small language models (SLMs) for accurate relevance labeling, enabling high-throughput, domain-specific labeling comparable or even better in quality to that of state-of-the-art large lang...

**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CY  

**Abstract:** Evaluating machine learning (ML) model bias is key to building trustworthy and robust ML systems. Counterfactual Fairness (CF) audits allow the measurement of bias of ML models with a causal framework, yet their conclusions rely on a single causal graph that is rarely known with certainty in real-world scenarios. We propose CF with Graph Uncertainty (CF-GU), a bias evaluation procedure that incorp...

**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Evaluating the instruction-following (IF) capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is essential for rigorously assessing how faithfully model outputs adhere to user-specified intentions. Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis...

### [Sparse Knowledge Distillation: A Mathematical Framework for Probability-Domain Temperature Scaling and Multi-Stage Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03195v1)
**Authors:** Aaron R. Flouro, Shawn P. Chadwick  
**Published:** 2026-01-06  
**Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We develop a unified theoretical framework for sparse knowledge distillation based on probability-domain softening operators. While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \propto \mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.   The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--v...
