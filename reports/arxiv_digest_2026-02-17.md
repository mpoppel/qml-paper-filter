### [Scaling QAOA: transferring optimal adiabatic schedules from small-scale to large-scale variational circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14986v1)
**Authors:** Ugo Nzongani, Dylan Laplace Mermoud, Arthur Braida  
**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a leading approach for combinatorial optimization on near-term quantum devices, yet its scalability is limited by the difficulty of optimizing \(2p\) variational parameters for a large number \(p\) of layers. Recent empirical studies indicate that optimal QAOA angles exhibit concentration and transferability across problem sizes. Leveraging ...

### [Distributed Quantum Gaussian Processes for Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15006v1)
**Authors:** Meet Gandhi, George P. Kontoudis  
**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** cs.MA, cs.LG, math.DG  

**Abstract:** Gaussian Processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic modeling, but their performance is often constrained in complex, largescale real-world domains due to the limited expressivity of classical kernels. Quantum computing offers the potential to overcome this limitation by embedding data into exponentially large Hilbert spaces, capturing complex correlations that remain inaccessible to cla...

### [Low Depth Unitary Coupled Cluster Algorithm for Large Chemical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14999v1)
**Authors:** Jeremy Canfield, Dominika Zgid, J K Freericks  
**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) algorithm is one of the most promising implementations of the variational quantum eigensolver for quantum computers. However, for large systems, the number of UCC factors leads to deep quantum circuits, which are prohibitive for execution on quantum hardware. To address this, circuit depth can be reduced at the cost of more measurements with a Taylor series expans...

### [Rethinking Diffusion Models with Symmetries through Canonicalization with Applications to Molecular Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15022v1)
**Authors:** Cai Zhou, Zijie Chen, Zian Li et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, math.GR, q-bio.BM  

**Abstract:** Many generative tasks in chemistry and science involve distributions invariant to group symmetries (e.g., permutation and rotation). A common strategy enforces invariance and equivariance through architectural constraints such as equivariant denoisers and invariant priors. In this paper, we challenge this tradition through the alternative canonicalization perspective: first map each sample to an o...

**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Many robot tasks require attending to the history of past observations. For example, finding an item in a room requires remembering which places have already been searched. However, the best-performing robot policies typically condition only on the current observation, limiting their applicability to such tasks. Naively conditioning on past observations often fails due to spurious correlations: po...

**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Although learned representations underlie neural networks' success, their fundamental properties remain poorly understood. A striking example is the emergence of simple geometric structures in LLM representations: for example, calendar months organize into a circle, years form a smooth one-dimensional manifold, and cities' latitudes and longitudes can be decoded by a linear probe. We show that the...

**Authors:** Eloi Martinet, Ilias Ftouhi  
**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We introduce a novel numerical framework for the exploration of Blaschke--Santaló diagrams, which are efficient tools characterizing the possible inequalities relating some given shape functionals. We introduce a parametrization of convex bodies in arbitrary dimensions using a specific invertible neural network architecture based on gauge functions, allowing an intrinsic conservation of the convex...

### [Infinite reduction in absorbing time in quantum walks over classical ones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14880v1)

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study the absorption time and spreading rate of the discrete-time quantum walk propagating on a line in the presence or absence of an absorber. We analytically establish that in the presence of an absorber, the average absorption time of the quantum walker is finite, contrary to the behavior of a classical random walker, indicating an infinite resource reduction on moving over to a quantum vers...

### [Gravitational Decoherence Estimation in Optomechanical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14841v1)
**Authors:** Leonardo A. M. Souza, Olimpio P. de Sá Neto, Enrico Russo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We develop a comprehensive quantum estimation framework to quantify how precisely gravitationally induced decoherence can be inferred in optomechanical systems, using single-mode Gaussian probe states. Our approach combines a microscopic description of the gravitational diffusion mechanism with quantum Fisher information to determine the ultimate sensitivity achievable in principle. We show that g...

### [Scalable Multi-Robot Path Planning via Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14799v1)
**Authors:** Javier González Villasmil  
**Published:** 2026-02-16  
**Updated:** 2026-02-16  
**Categories:** cs.RO, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, where classical centralized approaches exhibit exponential growth in joint-state complexity as the number of agents increases. This paper investigates Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) as a structurally scalable alternative for simultaneous multi-robot path planning. This approach is a robotics-oriented Q...
