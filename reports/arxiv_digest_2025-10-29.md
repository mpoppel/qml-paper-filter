**Abstract:** We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This f...

**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled) data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the coupled field. Specifically, we inv...

### [Accelerated relaxation and Mpemba-like effect for operators in open quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24630v1)
**Authors:** Pitambar Bagui, Arijit Chatterjee, Bijay Kumar Agarwalla  
**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**Updated:** 2025-10-28  
**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum Mpemba effect occurs when a quantum system, residing far away from the steady state, relaxes faster than a relatively nearer state. We look for the presence of this highly counterintuitive effect in the relaxation dynamics of the operators within the open quantum system setting. Since the operators evolve under a non-trace preserving map, the trace distance of an operator is not a monotoni...

**Published:** 2025-10-28  
**Updated:** 2025-10-28  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we pr...

**Abstract:** The construction of parent Hamiltonians that possess a given state as their ground state is a well-studied problem. In this work, we generalize this notion by considering simple quantum states and examining the local Hamiltonians that have these states as exact eigenstates.These states often correspond to Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) of their respective parent Hamiltonians.Motivated by earlier w...

**Abstract:** We study bilevel optimization problems where the lower-level problems are strongly convex and have coupled linear constraints. To overcome the potential non-smoothness of the hyper-objective and the computational challenges associated with the Hessian matrix, we utilize penalty and augmented Lagrangian methods to reformulate the original problem as a single-level one. Especially, we establish a st...

**Updated:** 2025-10-28  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, q-bio.NC  

**Abstract:** Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-...

**Abstract:** LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details.

**Categories:** math-ph, math.MP, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce the notion of a field of covariances, a contravariant functor from non-commutative probability spaces to Hilbert spaces, as the natural categorical analogue of statistical covariance. In the case of finite-dimensional non-commutative probability spaces, we obtain a complete classification of such fields. Our results unify classical and quantum information geometry: in the tracial case...

**Abstract:** For any element $g$ of compact reductive group $G$ we investigate the asymptotic behavior of its normalized irreducible character in the high-dimension limit, $\frac{\chi_\lambda(g)}{d_\lambda}$. We show that when $G$ is simple the limit vanishes besides identity element. For semisimple groups one gets the same results under the additional assumption that dimensions of irreducible representations ...
