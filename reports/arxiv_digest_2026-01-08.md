### [Embedding Autonomous Agents in Resource-Constrained Robotic Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04191v1)
**Authors:** Negar Halakou, Juan F. Gutierrez, Ye Sun et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Many embedded devices operate under resource constraints and in dynamic environments, requiring local decision-making capabilities. Enabling devices to make independent decisions in such environments can improve the responsiveness of the system and reduce the dependence on constant external control. In this work, we integrate an autonomous agent, programmed using AgentSpeak, with a small two-wheel...

### [Lightweight Test-Time Adaptation for EMG-Based Gesture Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04181v1)
**Authors:** Nia Touko, Matthew O A Ellis, Cristiano Capone et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.HC  

**Abstract:** Reliable long-term decoding of surface electromyography (EMG) is hindered by signal drift caused by electrode shifts, muscle fatigue, and posture changes. While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We pro...

### [Improved Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum Channels in Diamond Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04180v1)
**Authors:** Aadil Oufkir, Filippo Girardi  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ Ω\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ queries. This improves the best previous $Ω(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence, with a scaling in $\varepsilon$ that is near-opt...

### [Robust Physics Discovery from Highly Corrupted Data: A PINN Framework Applied to the Nonlinear Schrödinger Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04176v1)
**Authors:** Pietro de Oliveira Esteves  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** cs.LG, physics.comp-ph  

**Abstract:** We demonstrate a deep learning framework capable of recovering physical parameters from the Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (NLSE) under severe noise conditions. By integrating Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with automatic differentiation, we achieve reconstruction of the nonlinear coefficient beta with less than 0.2 percent relative error using only 500 sparse, randomly sampled data poin...

### [Agentic Rubrics as Contextual Verifiers for SWE Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04171v1)
**Authors:** Mohit Raghavendra, Anisha Gunjal, Bing Liu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Verification is critical for improving agents: it provides the reward signal for Reinforcement Learning and enables inference-time gains through Test-Time Scaling (TTS). Despite its importance, verification in software engineering (SWE) agent settings often relies on code execution, which can be difficult to scale due to environment setup overhead. Scalable alternatives such as patch classifiers a...

### [Agent Drift: Quantifying Behavioral Degradation in Multi-Agent LLM Systems Over Extended Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04170v1)
**Authors:** Abhishek Rath  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interact...

### [Clinical Data Goes MEDS? Let's OWL make sense of it](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04164v1)
**Authors:** Alberto Marfoglia, Jong Ho Jhee, Adrien Coulet  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows fr...

### [Scanner-Induced Domain Shifts Undermine the Robustness of Pathology Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04163v1)
**Authors:** Erik Thiringer, Fredrik K. Gustafsson, Kajsa Ledesma Eriksson et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** eess.IV, cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Pathology foundation models (PFMs) have become central to computational pathology, aiming to offer general encoders for feature extraction from whole-slide images (WSIs). Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to...

### [Below-shot-noise capacity in phase estimation using nonlinear interferometers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04139v1)
**Authors:** Cristofero Oglialoro, Gerard J. Machado, Felix Farsch et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-07  
**Updated:** 2026-01-07  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Over the past decade, several schemes for imaging and sensing based on nonlinear interferometers have been proposed and demonstrated experimentally. These interferometers exhibit two main advantages. First, they enable probing a sample at a chosen wavelength while detecting light at a different wavelength with high efficiency (bicolor quantum imaging and sensing with undetected light). Second, the...
