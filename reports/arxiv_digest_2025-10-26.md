**Abstract:** The ongoing progress in quantum technologies has fueled a sustained exploration of their potential applications across various domains. One particularly promising field is quantitative finance, where a central challenge is the pricing of financial derivatives-traditionally addressed through Monte Carlo integration techniques. In this work, we introduce two hybrid classical-quantum methods to addre...

### [Iterative Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier-enhanced Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19399v1)
**Authors:** Yulun Wu, Miguel Aguiar, Karl H. Johansson et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency components through Random Fou...

We report a constant-cost of no more than four applications of such Clifford entangling multiqubit gates to realize any sequence of Clifford operations of any length, without ...

### [Compositional Generation for Long-Horizon Coupled PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20141v1)
**Authors:** Somayajulu L. N. Dhulipala, Deep Ray, Nicholas Forman  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled) data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the coupled field. Specifically, we inv...

**Abstract:** We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This f...

### [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817v1)

**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in "mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with reverse/forward KL regulariz...

### [The complexity of perfect quantum state classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20789v1)
**Authors:** Nathaniel Johnston, Benjamin Lovitz, Vincent Russo et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The problem of quantum state classification asks how accurately one can identify an unknown quantum state that is promised to be drawn from a known set of pure states. In this work, we introduce the notion of $k$-learnability, which captures the ability to identify the correct state using at most $k$ guesses, with zero error. We show that deciding whether a given family of states is $k$-learnable ...

### [Out-of-distribution Tests Reveal Compositionality in Chess Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20783v1)
**Authors:** Anna Mészáros, Patrik Reizinger, Ferenc Huszár  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs - are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios, designed to reveal failu...

### [A Use-Case Specific Dataset for Measuring Dimensions of Responsible Performance in LLM-generated Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20782v1)
**Authors:** Alicia Sagae, Chia-Jung Lee, Sandeep Avula et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-23

**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, I.2.7  

**Abstract:** Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) typically focus on high-level tasks such as text generation, without targeting a particular AI application. This approach is not sufficient for evaluating LLMs for Responsible AI dimensions like fairness, since protected attributes that are highly relevant in one application may be less relevant in another. In this work, we construct a da...

**Abstract:** Recent advancements in large reasoning models (LRMs) have introduced an intermediate "thinking" process prior to generating final answers, improving their reasoning capabilities on complex downstream tasks. However, the potential of LRMs as evaluators for machine translation (MT) quality remains underexplored. We provides the first systematic analysis of LRM-as-a-judge in MT evaluation. We identif...

**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.HC  

**Abstract:** Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided data generation ...

**Published:** 2025-10-23

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing optimizati...

**Abstract:** Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces. However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging, remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for deep learning decodi...

It is one of the simplest examples of the cyclic RG where $\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model is integrable and shar...

**Abstract:** Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal distributions of...

**Abstract:** Identifying when observed statistics cannot be explained by any reasonable classical model is a central problem in quantum foundations. A principled and universally applicable approach to defining and identifying nonclassicality is given by the notion of generalized noncontextuality. Here, we study the typicality of contextuality -- namely, the likelihood that randomly chosen quantum preparations ...

**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The energy shift of an oscillator in blackbody radiation is calculated based simply on the total energy of the interacting field-oscillator system as a function of the refractive index. For high temperatures T the energy and free-energy shifts are found to vary as -T^2 and +T^2, respectively, in agreement with the result originally obtained by Ford, Lewis, and O'Connell [Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 2273 ...

**Abstract:** We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for constructing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. Assuming reflection positivity, we prove the equivalence between the non-degeneracy of the ground state on the sphere and the local-indistinguishability of local ground states of a frustration-free Hamiltonian. We apply the Osterwalder-Schra...
