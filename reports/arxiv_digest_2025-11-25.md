### [Flow Map Distillation Without Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19428v1)
**Authors:** Shangyuan Tong, Nanye Ma, Saining Xie et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-24  
**Updated:** 2025-11-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** State-of-the-art flow models achieve remarkable quality but require slow, iterative sampling. To accelerate this, flow maps can be distilled from pre-trained teachers, a procedure that conventionally requires sampling from an external dataset. We argue that this data-dependency introduces a fundamental risk of Teacher-Data Mismatch, as a static dataset may provide an incomplete or even misaligned ...

**Published:** 2025-11-24  
**Updated:** 2025-11-24  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at reasoning in linguistic space but struggle with perceptual understanding that requires dense visual perception, e.g., spatial reasoning and geometric awareness. This limitation stems from the fact that current VLMs have limited mechanisms to capture dense visual information across spatial dimensions. We introduce Chain-of-Visual-Thought (COVT), a framework th...

**Published:** 2025-11-24  
**Updated:** 2025-11-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** We propose a general connection between entanglement-entropy scaling laws and the linear response functions of particle-conserving fermionic systems in their ground state. Specifically, we show that the response to perturbations coupled to the particle number within a finite region exhibits the same size scaling as the entanglement entropy of that region. We explicitly verify this scaling in free-...

### [Decoupling local classicality from classical explainability: A noncontextual model for bilocal classical theory and a locally-classical but contextual theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19266v1)

**Abstract:** We construct an ontological model for the theory known as bilocal classical theory doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052216. To our knowledge, this is only the second time that an ontological model has been constructed for an entire theory, rather than just for some particular scenarios within a theory. This result refutes a conjecture from doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevA.102.052216 which suggested that there...

**Abstract:** Taking inspiration from NMR spectroscopy, periodic irradiation schemes have recently shown remarkable performance when implemented into pulsed dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) sequences. This has prompted considerable interest in development of broadband pulsed DNP sequences utilizing such schemes. On this background, most efforts have focused on solid-state NMR like transverse spin-locked pulse...

### [A demonstration that classical gravity does not produce entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19242v1)
**Authors:** Mike D. Schneider, Nick Huggett, Niels Linnemann

**Abstract:** Once again, dispute has arisen over the interpretation of proposed quantum information theory experiments to probe the quantum nature of gravity by testing for gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) between two spatially separated massive particles ([1] vs. [11,12]; further contributions in [7,9]). The confusion appears to reside in interpreting applications of a Hamiltonian formalism. But cla...

### [Entropic Dynamics approach to Quantum Electrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19238v1)
**Authors:** Ariel Caticha  
**Published:** 2025-11-24  
**Updated:** 2025-11-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-th, math-ph  

**Abstract:** Entropic dynamics (ED) is a framework that allows one to derive quantum theory as a Hamilton-Killing flow on the cotangent bundle of a statistical manifold. These flows are such that they preserve the symplectic and the (information) metric geometries; they explain the linearity of quantum mechanics and the appearance of complex numbers. In this paper the ED framework is extended to deal with loca...
