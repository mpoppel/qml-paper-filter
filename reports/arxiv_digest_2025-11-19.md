### [Multi-GPU Quantum Circuit Simulation and the Impact of Network Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14664v1)
**Authors:** W. Michael Brown, Anurag Ramesh, Thomas Lubinski et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.DC, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** As is intrinsic to the fundamental goal of quantum computing, classical simulation of quantum algorithms is notoriously demanding in resource requirements. Nonetheless, simulation is critical to the success of the field and a requirement for algorithm development and validation, as well as hardware design. GPU-acceleration has become standard practice for simulation, and due to the exponential sca...

### [Static Laboratory-Frame Polarization of a Trapped Molecular Ion for CP-Violation Searches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14701v1)
**Authors:** Fabian Wolf  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** physics.atom-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Today's most sensitive experiments for detecting CP-violating permanent electric dipole moments (EDM) rely on molecular spectroscopy. The high sensitivity arises from large internal electric fields that interact with the constituents of the molecule. For molecular ions it has long been assumed that experiments with static polarization from dc electric fields are infeasible, as the ion's charge wou...

### [HyMAD: A Hybrid Multi-Activity Detection Approach for Border Surveillance and Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14698v1)
**Authors:** Sriram Srinivasan, Srinivasan Aruchamy, Siva Ram Krisha Vadali  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG, eess.SP  

**Abstract:** Seismic sensing has emerged as a promising solution for border surveillance and monitoring; the seismic sensors that are often buried underground are small and cannot be noticed easily, making them difficult for intruders to detect, avoid, or vandalize. This significantly enhances their effectiveness compared to highly visible cameras or fences. However, accurately detecting and distinguishing bet...

**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.ET  

**Abstract:** This paper introduces the DIRSH algorithm for the Qubit Routing Problem (QRP), using a heuristic-guided randomized divide-and-conquer strategy. The method splits the circuit into chunks and optimizes each one with a stochastic selection of gates and swaps. It balances global search, via restarts and adaptive tuning of bandit parameters with depth-sensitive local pruning. Tested on RevLib benchmark...

### [Measuring Reactive-Load Impedance with Transmission-Line Resonators Beyond the Perturbative Limit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14621v1)
**Authors:** Xuanjing Chu, Jinho Park, Jesse Balgley et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.supr-con, physics.app-ph  

**Abstract:** We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the frame...

### [PAC global optimization for VQE in low-curvature geometric regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14628v1)
**Authors:** Benjamin Asch  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We give noise-robust, Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) guarantees of global $\varepsilon$-optimality for the Variational Quantum Eigensolver under explicit geometric conditions. For periodic ansatzes with bounded generators -- yielding a globally Lipschitz cost landscape on a toroidal parameter space -- we assume that the low-energy region containing the global minimum is a Morse--Bott submani...

### [Optimization of High-Fidelity Single-Qubit Gates for Fluxoniums Using Single-Flux Quantum Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14746v1)
**Authors:** Maxime Lapointe-Major, Boyan Torosov, Bohdan Kulchytskyy et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a gradient-based method to construct memory-efficient, high-fidelity, single-qubit gates for fluxonium qubits. These gates are constructed using a sequence of single-flux quantum (SFQ) pulses that are sent to the qubit through either capacitive or inductive coupling. The schedule of SFQ pulses is constructed with an on-ramp and an off-ramp applied prior to and after a pulse train, where...

### [From Random Determinants to the Ground State](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14734v1)
**Authors:** Hao Zhang, Matthew Otten  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.str-el, physics.chem-ph  

**Abstract:** Accurate quantum many-body calculations often depend on reliable reference states or good human-designed ansätze, yet these sources of knowledge can become unreliable in hard problems like strongly correlated systems. We introduce the Trimmed Configuration Interaction (TrimCI) method, a prior-knowledge-free algorithm that builds accurate ground states directly from random Slater determinants. Trim...

### [ARC Is a Vision Problem!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14761v1)
**Authors:** Keya Hu, Ali Cy, Linlu Qiu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is designed to promote research on abstract reasoning, a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. Common approaches to ARC treat it as a language-oriented problem, addressed by large language models (LLMs) or recurrent reasoning models. However, although the puzzle-like tasks in ARC are inherently visual, existing research has rarely approached the probl...

**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** We study how vision-language-action (VLA) models can improve through real-world deployments via reinforcement learning (RL). We present a general-purpose method, RL with Experience and Corrections via Advantage-conditioned Policies (RECAP), that provides for RL training of VLAs via advantage conditioning. Our method incorporates heterogeneous data into the self-improvement process, including demon...

### [Robust Verification of Controllers under State Uncertainty via Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14755v1)
**Authors:** Albert Lin, Alessandro Pinto, Somil Bansal  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.LG, eess.SY  

**Abstract:** As perception-based controllers for autonomous systems become increasingly popular in the real world, it is important that we can formally verify their safety and performance despite perceptual uncertainty. Unfortunately, the verification of such systems remains challenging, largely due to the complexity of the controllers, which are often nonlinear, nonconvex, learning-based, and/or black-box. Pr...

**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Critical exponents characterize the divergent scaling of thermodynamic quantities near phase transitions and allow for the classification of physical systems into universality classes. While quantum gases thermalizing by interparticle interactions fall into the XY model universality class, the ideal Bose gas has been predicted to form a distinct universality class whose signatures have not yet bee...

### [Look-Ahead Reasoning on Learning Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14745v1)
**Authors:** Haiqing Zhu, Tijana Zrnic, Celestine Mendler-Dünner  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.GT, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on s...

### [Beyond Means: A Dynamic Framework for Predicting Customer Satisfaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14743v1)
**Authors:** Christof Naumzik, Abdurahman Maarouf, Stefan Feuerriegel et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Online ratings influence customer decision-making, yet standard aggregation methods, such as the sample mean, fail to adapt to quality changes over time and ignore review heterogeneity (e.g., review sentiment, a review's helpfulness). To address these challenges, we demonstrate the value of using the Gaussian process (GP) framework for rating aggregation. Specifically, we present a tailored GP mod...

### [LAUD: Integrating Large Language Models with Active Learning for Unlabeled Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14738v1)
**Authors:** Tzu-Hsuan Chou, Chun-Nan Chou  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown a remarkable ability to generalize beyond their pre-training data, and fine-tuning LLMs can elevate performance to human-level and beyond. However, in real-world scenarios, lacking labeled data often prevents practitioners from obtaining well-performing models, thereby forcing practitioners to highly rely on prompt-based approaches that are often tedious, in...

### [Quantum State Preparation with Resolution Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14732v1)
**Authors:** Scott Bogner, Heiko Hergert, Morten Hjorth-Jensen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat, nucl-th  

**Abstract:** We introduce a method called resolution refinement that allows one to bootstrap eigenstate preparation on a quantum computer. We first prepare an eigenstate of a low-resolution Hamiltonian using any method of choice. The eigenstate is then lifted to higher resolution and adiabatically evolved to produce the corresponding eigenstate of a higher-fidelity Hamiltonian. We give examples of resolution r...

### [Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for Power Distribution System Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14730v1)
**Authors:** Parya Dolatyabi, Mahdi Khodayar  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Restoring power distribution systems (PDS) after large-scale outages requires sequential switching operations that reconfigure feeder topology and coordinate distributed energy resources (DERs) under nonlinear constraints such as power balance, voltage limits, and thermal ratings. These challenges make conventional optimization and value-based RL approaches computationally inefficient and difficul...

### [Automated proving in planar geometry based on the complex number identity method and elimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14728v1)
**Authors:** Zoltán Kovács, Xicheng Peng  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.CG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We improve the complex number identity proving method to a fully automated procedure, based on elimination ideals. By using declarative equations or rewriting each real-relational hypothesis $h_i$ to $h_i-r_i$, and the thesis $t$ to $t-r$, clearing the denominators and introducing an extra expression with a slack variable, we eliminate all free and relational point variables. From the obtained ide...

### [AdamHD: Decoupled Huber Decay Regularization for Language Model Pre-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14721v1)
**Authors:** Fu-Ming Guo, Yingfang Fan  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC  

**Abstract:** Adaptive optimizers with decoupled weight decay, such as AdamW, are the de facto standard for pre-training large transformer-based generative models. Yet the quadratic nature of the $\ell_2$ penalty embedded in weight decay drives all parameters toward the origin at the same rate, making the update vulnerable to rare but extreme gradient directions and often over-penalizing well-conditioned coordi...

**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR, cs.DC, cs.MA  

**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, it remains vulnerable to malicious clients who compromise model integrity through Byzantine attacks, data poisoning, or adaptive adversarial behaviors. Existing defense mechanisms rely on static thresholds and binary classification, failing to adapt to evolving client behaviors in real-world deploy...

**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We establish the first global convergence result of neural networks for two stage least squares (2SLS) approach in nonparametric instrumental variable regression (NPIV). This is achieved by adopting a lifted perspective through mean-field Langevin dynamics (MFLD), unlike standard MFLD, however, our setting of 2SLS entails a \emph{bilevel} optimization problem in the space of probability measures. ...

### [Pure gapped ground states of spin chains are short-range entangled](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14699v1)
**Authors:** Wojciech De Roeck, Martin Fraas, Bruno de O. Carvalho  
**Published:** 2025-11-18  
**Updated:** 2025-11-18  
**Categories:** math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We consider spin chains with a finite range Hamiltonian. For reasons of simplicity, the chain is taken to be infinitely long. A ground state is said to be a unique gapped ground state if its GNS Hamiltonian has a unique ground state, separated by a gap from the rest of the spectrum. By combining some powerful techniques developed in the last years, we prove that each unique gapped ground state is ...

**Abstract:** Trained on massive cross-species DNA corpora, DNA large language models (LLMs) learn the fundamental "grammar" and evolutionary patterns of genomic sequences. This makes them powerful priors for DNA sequence modeling, particularly over long ranges. However, two major constraints hinder their use in practice: the quadratic computational cost of self-attention and the growing memory required for key...

This biological principle inspired the attention mechanism in modern Transformers. Transformers now underpin large language models (LLMs) such as GPT, but at the cost of massive training and inference energy, leading to a large carbon footprint. While brain attention emerges from neural ...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum information theory is a rapidly growing area of math and physics that combines two independent theories, quantum mechanics and information theory. Quantum entanglement is a concept that was first proposed in the EPR paradox. In quantum mechanics, particles can be in superposition, meaning they are in multiple different states at once. It is not until the particle is measured that it is for...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Coherence is an inherently quantum property that deeply affects microscopic processes, including thermalization phenomena. A striking example is the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), in which a system can exhibit anomalous relaxation, thermalizing faster from a state initially farther from equilibrium than from one closer. Here, we experimentally investigate the genuine QME and observe how the dynamics...
