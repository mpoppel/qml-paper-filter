### [Random Spiking Neural Networks are Stable and Spectrally Simple](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00904v1)
**Authors:** Ernesto Araya, Massimiliano Datres, Gitta Kutyniok  
**Published:** 2025-11-02  
**Updated:** 2025-11-02  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising paradigm for energy-efficient computation, yet their theoretical foundations-especially regarding stability and robustness-remain limited compared to artificial neural networks. In this work, we study discrete-time leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) SNNs through the lens of Boolean function analysis. We focus on noise sensitivity and stability in classifi...

### [The Born Ultimatum: Conditions for Classical Surrogation of Quantum Generative Models with Correlators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01845v1)
**Authors:** Mario Herrero-Gonzalez, Brian Coyle, Kieran McDowall et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-03  
**Updated:** 2025-11-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) are powerful quantum generative models that sample according to the Born rule, with complexity-theoretic evidence suggesting potential quantum advantages for generative tasks. Here, we identify QCBMs as a quantum Fourier model independently of the loss function. This allows us to apply known dequantization conditions when the optimal quantum distribution is av...

Here, we present a training-free explanation method that replaces dense masks with smooth tunable contours. A star-convex region is parameterized by a truncated Fourier series and optimized under an extremal preserve...

### [Memory-Efficient Training with In-Place FFT Implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01385v1)
**Authors:** Xinyu Ding, Bangtian Liu, Siyu Liao et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-03  
**Updated:** 2025-11-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, I.2.6; G.1.2; D.1.3  

**Abstract:** Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are widely used to reduce memory and computational costs in deep learning. However, existing implementations, including standard FFT and real FFT (rFFT), cannot achieve true in-place computation. In particular, rFFT maps an input of size n to a complex output of size n/2+1, causing dimensional mismatch and requiring additional memory allocation. We propose the first r...

Here, we propose a novel variational quantum algorithm to solve it. The method is based on the preparation of two maximally entangled quantum registers whose correlations are assigned to different paths between pairs of cities. For $N$ cities, this encoding requires $2 \lce...

### [Controlling Hong-Ou-Mandel antibunching via parity governed spectral shaping of biphoton states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04604v1)
**Authors:** Mikhail Guselnikov, Alexei D. Kiselev, Andrei Gaidash et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**Updated:** 2025-11-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate into experimentally detectable effects such as the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) bunching and antibunching. These regimes can be characterized using the symmetry degree parameter $D_S$ that enters the two-photon coincidence probability $P_{2c}=(1-D_S)/2$. In the case of HOM bunching (antibunching), $D_S$ is positive (negative). Though the symmetry degree can generally be expressed in terms o...

**Abstract:** In the search with wildcards problem [Ambainis, Montanaro, Quantum Inf.~Comput.'14], one's goal is to learn an unknown bit-string $x \in \{-1,1\}^n$. An algorithm may, at unit cost, test equality of any subset of the hidden string with a string of its choice. Ambainis and Montanaro showed a quantum algorithm of cost $O(\sqrt{n} \log n)$ and a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Belovs...

### [Photodetection of Squeezed Light: a Whittaker-Shannon Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04657v1)
**Authors:** Jasper Kranias, Christian Drago, Colin Vendromin et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**Updated:** 2025-11-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Whittaker-Shannon decomposition provides a temporally localized description of squeezed light, making it applicable in the CW limit and leading to a definition of squeezing strength based on the number of photon pairs at a time. We show examples of its usefulness by calculating quadrature variance in a homodyne detection scheme, coincidence detection probabilities in the continuous-wave limit,...

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning, particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists of a growing numb...

### [Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04647v1)
**Authors:** Sitan Chen, Kevin Cong, Jerry Li  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**Updated:** 2025-11-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens out-of-order and, o...

**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG, cs.MA  

**Abstract:** Cooperative multi-agent planning requires agents to make joint decisions with partial information and limited communication. Coordination at the trajectory level often fails, as small deviations in timing or movement cascade into conflicts. Symbolic planning mitigates this challenge by raising the level of abstraction and providing a minimal vocabulary of actions that enable synchronization and co...

### [Addressing divergent representations from causal interventions on neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04638v1)
**Authors:** Satchel Grant, Simon Jerome Han, Alexa Tartaglini et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-06  
**Updated:** 2025-11-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural st...

**Abstract:** We propose a method for modifying orthogonal sparse matrix pairs used in CSS codes while preserving their matrix row and column weight distributions, which play a crucial role in determining the performance of belief-propagation decoding. Unlike simple row or column permutations that merely reorder existing elements, the proposed local modification introduces genuine structural randomness through ...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** Quantum cryptography is a rapidly-developing area which leverages quantum information to accomplish classically-impossible tasks. In many of these protocols, quantum states are used as long-term cryptographic keys. Typically, this is to ensure the keys cannot be copied by an adversary, owing to the quantum no-cloning theorem. Unfortunately, due to quantum state's tendency to decohere, persistent q...

**Abstract:** We introduce quantum-enhanced memetic tabu search (QE-MTS), a non-variational hybrid algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art scaling for the low-autocorrelation binary sequence (LABS) problem. By seeding the classical MTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution scaling to $\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)...

By tropicalization, this implies that there exist uniform $(\max,+,-)$-circuits and ReLU neural networks of the same size for weighted basis maximization of regular matroids. As a consequence in linear programming theory, we obtain a first examp...

However, machine learning and side-channel attacks increasingly undermine their classical assumptions, calling for new approaches to ensure unforgeability. Quantum mechanics naturally supports this goal through intrinsic randomness and the no-cloning theorem, ...
