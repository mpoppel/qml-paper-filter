### [Scalable Suppression of XY Crosstalk by Pulse-Level Control in Superconducting Quantum Processors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05231v1)
**Authors:** Hui-Hang Chen, Chiao-Hsuan Wang  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** As superconducting quantum processors continue to scale, high-performance quantum control becomes increasingly critical. In densely integrated architectures, unwanted interactions between nearby qubits give rise to crosstalk errors that limit operational performance. In particular, direct exchange-type (XY) interactions are typically minimized by designing large frequency detunings between neighbo...

### [When and why non-Hermitian eigenvalues miss eigenstates in topological physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05234v1)
**Authors:** Lucien Jezequel, Loïc Herviou, Jens Bardarson  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Non-Hermitian systems exhibit a fundamental spectral dichotomy absent in Hermitian physics: the eigenvalue spectrum and the eigenstate spectrum can deviate significantly in the thermodynamic limit. We explain how non-Hermitian Hamiltonians can support eigenstates completely undetected by eigenvalues, with the unidirectional Hatano-Nelson model serving as both a minimal realization and universal pa...

### [Simulation of noisy quantum circuits using frame representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05131v1)
**Authors:** Janek Denzler, Jose Carrasco, Jens Eisert et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** One of the core research questions in the theory of quantum computing is to find out to what precise extent the classical simulation of a noisy quantum circuits is possible and where potential quantum advantages can set in. In this work, we introduce a unified framework for the classical simulation of quantum circuits based on frame theory, encompassing and generalizing a broad class of existing s...

**Abstract:** Molecular dynamics simulations are a central computational methodology in materials design for relating atomic composition to mechanical properties. However, simulating materials with atomic-level resolution on a macroscopic scale is infeasible on current classical hardware, even when using the simplest elastic network models (ENMs) that represent molecular vibrations as a network of coupled oscil...

### [Optimal Lower Bounds for Online Multicalibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05245v1)
**Authors:** Natalie Collina, Jiuyao Lu, Georgy Noarov et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.ST, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We prove tight lower bounds for online multicalibration, establishing an information-theoretic separation from marginal calibration.   In the general setting where group functions can depend on both context and the learner's predictions, we prove an $Ω(T^{2/3})$ lower bound on expected multicalibration error using just three disjoint binary groups. This matches the upper bounds of Noarov et al. (2...

### [GDPO: Group reward-Decoupled Normalization Policy Optimization for Multi-reward RL Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05242v1)
**Authors:** Shih-Yang Liu, Xin Dong, Ximing Lu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** As language models become increasingly capable, users expect them to provide not only accurate responses but also behaviors aligned with diverse human preferences across a variety of scenarios. To achieve this, Reinforcement learning (RL) pipelines have begun incorporating multiple rewards, each capturing a distinct preference, to guide models toward these desired behaviors. However, recent work h...

**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** The diversity, quantity, and quality of manipulation data are critical for training effective robot policies. However, due to hardware and physical setup constraints, collecting large-scale real-world manipulation data remains difficult to scale across diverse environments. Recent work uses text-prompt conditioned image diffusion models to augment manipulation data by altering the backgrounds and ...

### [Robust Reasoning as a Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05240v1)
**Authors:** Ilmo Sung  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cond-mat.dis-nn, cs.AI, hep-th  

**Abstract:** Large language models suffer from "hallucinations"-logical inconsistencies induced by semantic noise. We propose that current architectures operate in a "Metric Phase," where causal order is vulnerable to spontaneous symmetry breaking. Here, we identify robust inference as an effective Symmetry-Protected Topological phase, where logical operations are formally isomorphic to non-Abelian anyon braid...

**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.CY, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We used machine learning and artificial intelligence: 1) to measure levels of peace in countries from news and social media and 2) to develop on-line tools that promote peace by helping users better understand their own media diet. For news media, we used neural networks to measure levels of peace from text embeddings of on-line news sources. The model, trained on one news media dataset also showe...

### [Learning Latent Action World Models In The Wild](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05230v1)
**Authors:** Quentin Garrido, Tushar Nagarajan, Basile Terver et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Agents capable of reasoning and planning in the real world require the ability of predicting the consequences of their actions. While world models possess this capability, they most often require action labels, that can be complex to obtain at scale. This motivates the learning of latent action models, that can learn an action space from videos alone. Our work addresses the problem of learning lat...

### [Stochastic Deep Learning: A Probabilistic Framework for Modeling Uncertainty in Structured Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05227v1)
**Authors:** James Rice  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, econ.EM, math.ST  

**Abstract:** I propose a novel framework that integrates stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with deep generative models to improve uncertainty quantification in machine learning applications involving structured and temporal data. This approach, termed Stochastic Latent Differential Inference (SLDI), embeds an Itô SDE in the latent space of a variational autoencoder, allowing for flexible, continuous-tim...

### [Fast convergence of Majorana Propagation for weakly interacting fermions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05226v1)
**Authors:** Giorgio Facelli, Hamza Fawzi, Omar Fawzi  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Simulating the time dynamics of an observable under Hamiltonian evolution is one of the most promising candidates for quantum advantage as we do not expect efficient classical algorithms for this problem except in restricted settings. Here, we introduce such a setting by showing that Majorana Propagation, a simple algorithm combining Trotter steps and truncations, efficiently finds a low-degree ap...

### [CAOS: Conformal Aggregation of One-Shot Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05219v1)
**Authors:** Maja Waldron  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** One-shot prediction enables rapid adaptation of pretrained foundation models to new tasks using only one labeled example, but lacks principled uncertainty quantification. While conformal prediction provides finite-sample coverage guarantees, standard split conformal methods are inefficient in the one-shot setting due to data splitting and reliance on a single predictor. We propose Conformal Aggreg...

### [Cat states and violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in relativistic Quantum Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05216v1)
**Authors:** M. S. Guimaraes, I. Roditi, S. P. Sorella  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** hep-th, math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A cat state localized in the right Rindler wedge is employed to study the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar free Quantum Field Theory. By means of the bounded Hermitian operator $sign(\varphi(f))$, where $\varphi(f)$ stands for the smeared scalar field, it turns out that the Bell-CHSH correlator can be evaluated in closed analytic form in terms of the imaginary error f...

### [Internal Representations as Indicators of Hallucinations in Agent Tool Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05214v1)
**Authors:** Kait Healy, Bharathi Srinivasan, Visakh Madathil et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in tool calling and tool usage, but suffer from hallucinations where they choose incorrect tools, provide malformed parameters and exhibit 'tool bypass' behavior by performing simulations and generating outputs instead of invoking specialized tools or external systems. This undermines the reliability of LLM based agents in production ...

**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.PF  

**Abstract:** Pervasive AI increasingly depends on on-device learning systems that deliver low-latency and energy-efficient computation under strict resource constraints. Liquid State Machines (LSMs) offer a promising approach for low-power temporal processing in pervasive and neuromorphic systems, but their deployment remains challenging due to high hyperparameter sensitivity and the computational cost of trad...

### [Mechanisms of Prompt-Induced Hallucination in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05201v1)
**Authors:** William Rudman, Michal Golovanevsky, Dana Arad et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Large vision-language models (VLMs) are highly capable, yet often hallucinate by favoring textual prompts over visual evidence. We study this failure mode in a controlled object-counting setting, where the prompt overstates the number of objects in the image (e.g., asking a model to describe four waterlilies when only three are present). At low object counts, models often correct the overestimatio...

**Published:** 2026-01-08  
**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Chiral graviton modes are hallmark collective excitations of Fractional Quantum Hall (FQH) liquids. However, their existence on the lattice, where continuum symmetries that protect them from decay are lost, is still an open and urgent question, especially considering the recent advances in the realization of Fractional Chern Insulators (FCI) in transition metal dichalcogenides and rhombohedral pen...

**Abstract:** When researchers deploy large language models for autonomous tasks like reviewing literature or generating hypotheses, the computational bills add up quickly. A single research session using a 70-billion parameter model can cost around $127 in cloud fees, putting these tools out of reach for many academic labs. We developed AgentCompress to tackle this problem head-on. The core idea came from a si...

**Updated:** 2026-01-08  
**Categories:** cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.str-el, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We explore the limitations of using imbalance dynamics as a diagnostic tool for many-body localization (MBL) and show that spatial averaging can mask important microscopic features. Focusing on the strongly disordered regime of the random-field XXZ chain, we use state-of-the-art numerical techniques (Krylov time evolution and full diagonalization) to demonstrate that site-resolved spin autocorrela...

**Abstract:** Bell non-locality is a powerful framework to distinguish classical, quantum and post-quantum resources, which relies on non-communicating players. Under which restriction can we have the same separations, if we allow for communication? Non-signalling state assemblages, and the fact that they can always be simultaneously purified, turned out to be the key element to restrict the simplest bipartite ...
