### [Enhanced Distributed Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Large-Scale MaxCut Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22056v1)
**Authors:** Yuefeng Lin, Kun Wang, Qinyuan Zheng et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** MaxCut is a canonical NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem in graph theory with broad applications ranging from physics to bioinformatics. Although variational quantum algorithms offer promising new approaches that may eventually outperform classical schemes, they suffer from resource constraints and trainability issues such as barren plateaus, making large-scale instances intractable on noi...

### [Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Real-World Finance: Scalable Solutions for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22001v1)
**Authors:** Irene De León, Danel Arias, Manuel Martín-Cordero et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, q-fin.CP, q-fin.PM  

**Abstract:** We present a scalable, hardware-aware methodology for extending the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to large, realistic Dynamic Portfolio Optimization (DPO) problems. Building on the scaling strategy from our previous work, where we tailored a VQE workflow to both the DPO formulation and the target QPU, we now put forward two significant advances. The first is the implementation of the Ising...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.str-el  

**Abstract:** The hypergraph product (HGP) construction of quantum error-correcting codes (QECC) offers a general and explicit method for building a QECC from two classical codes, thereby paving the way for the discovery of good quantum low-density parity-check codes. In this letter, we propose a general and explicit construction recipe for QECCs from a total of D classical codes for arbitrary D. Following this...

### [A simple realization of Weyl-Heisenberg covariant measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22111v1)
**Authors:** Sachin Gupta, Matthew B. Weiss  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Informationally complete (IC) measurements are fundamental tools in quantum information processing, yet their physical implementation remains challenging. By the Naimark extension theorem, an IC measurement may be realized by a von Neumann measurement on an extended system after a suitable interaction. In this work, we elaborate on a simple algorithm for realizing Naimark extensions for rank-one W...

### [A Fundamental Theorem on Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen Steering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22030v1)
**Authors:** Yu-Xuan Zhang, Jing-Ling Chen  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum nonlocality is an essential nonlocality resource in quantum information. It has been classified into three distinct types: quantum entanglement, Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and Bell's nonlocality. In 1991, Gisin presented a fundamental theorem on Bell's nonlocality, pointing out all pure entangled states possess Bell's nonloclaity. Many of the core protocols of quantum informat...

### [Information Critical Phases under Decoherence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22121v1)
**Authors:** Akash Vijay, Jong Yeon Lee  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** Quantum critical phases are extended regions of phase space characterized by a diverging correlation length. By analogy, we define an information critical phase as an extended region of a mixed state phase diagram where the Markov length, the characteristic length scale governing the decay of the conditional mutual information (CMI), diverges.   We demonstrate that such a phase arises in decohered...

### [Charge-Informed Quantum Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22119v1)
**Authors:** Vlad Temkin, Zack Weinstein, Ruihua Fan et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, cond-mat.str-el  

**Abstract:** We investigate the statistical physics of quantum error correction in ${\rm U}(1)$ symmetry-enriched topological quantum memories. Starting from a phenomenological error model of charge-conserving noise, we study the optimal decoder assuming the local charges of each anyon can be measured. The error threshold of the optimal decoder corresponds to a continuous phase transition in a disordered two-d...

**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** cs.DC, cs.AI, cs.SE  

**Abstract:** Cloud incidents pose major operational challenges in production, with unresolved production cloud incidents cost on average over $2M per hour. Prior research identifies code- and configuration-related issues as the predominant category of root causes in cloud incidents. This paper introduces PRAXIS, an orchestrator that manages and deploys an agentic workflow for diagnosing code- and configuration...

### [Thermalization within a Stark manifold through Rydberg atom interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22110v1)
**Authors:** Sarah E. Spielman, Sage M. Thomas, Maja Teofilovska et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** One explanation of the thermalization of an isolated quantum system is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which posits that all energy eigenstates are thermal. Based on this idea, we use dynamical typicality to predict the thermal state of ultracold Rb atoms exchanging energy via long-range dipole-dipole interactions. In a magneto-optical trap, we excite the atoms to the center of a manifol...

### [Pruning as a Game: Equilibrium-Driven Sparsification of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22106v1)
**Authors:** Zubair Shah, Noaman Khan  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model para...

### [Explainable Multimodal Regression via Information Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22102v1)
**Authors:** Zhaozhao Ma, Shujian Yu  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regressio...

### [Unifying Learning Dynamics and Generalization in Transformers Scaling Law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22088v1)
**Authors:** Chiwun Yang  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** The scaling law, a cornerstone of Large Language Model (LLM) development, predicts improvements in model performance with increasing computational resources. Yet, while empirically validated, its theoretical underpinnings remain poorly understood. This work formalizes the learning dynamics of transformer-based language models as an ordinary differential equation (ODE) system, then approximates thi...

### [A Frobenius-Optimal Projection for Enforcing Linear Conservation in Learned Dynamical Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22084v1)
**Authors:** John M. Mango, Ronald Katende  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** math.DS, cs.LG, math.NA  

**Abstract:** We consider the problem of restoring linear conservation laws in data-driven linear dynamical models. Given a learned operator $\widehat{A}$ and a full-rank constraint matrix $C$ encoding one or more invariants, we show that the matrix closest to $\widehat{A}$ in the Frobenius norm and satisfying $C^\top A = 0$ is the orthogonal projection $A^\star = \widehat{A} - C(C^\top C)^{-1}C^\top \widehat{A...

### [Scaling Adversarial Training via Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22069v1)
**Authors:** Youran Ye, Dejin Wang, Ajinkya Bhandare  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) is a strong and widely used first-order adversarial attack, yet its computational cost scales poorly, as all training samples undergo identical iterative inner-loop optimization despite contributing unequally to robustness. Motivated by this inefficiency, we propose \emph{Selective Adversarial Training}, which perturbs only a subset of critical samples in each mini...

### [Why Smooth Stability Assumptions Fail for ReLU Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22055v1)
**Authors:** Ronald Katende  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC  

**Abstract:** Stability analyses of modern learning systems are frequently derived under smoothness assumptions that are violated by ReLU-type nonlinearities. In this note, we isolate a minimal obstruction by showing that no uniform smoothness-based stability proxy such as gradient Lipschitzness or Hessian control can hold globally for ReLU networks, even in simple settings where training trajectories appear em...

### [Quantum Secret Sharing Rates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22049v1)
**Authors:** Gabrielle Lalou, Husein Natur, Uzi Pereg  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.IT  

**Abstract:** This paper studies the capacity limits for quantum secret sharing (QSS). The goal of a QSS scheme is to distribute a quantum secret among multiple participants, such that only authorized parties can recover it through collaboration, while no information can be obtained without such collaboration. Following the approach of Zou et al. (2015) on classical secret sharing, we introduce an information-t...

### [Towards an understanding of dipole-dipole interactions in nonlocal media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22041v1)
**Authors:** L. Inácio, A. Kurumbail, S. K. Panja et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.atom-ph  

**Abstract:** We commence our study with review of dispersion interactions in electrolytes. We then reflect on how background media change atom-atom excited-state systems. To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\propto e^{-κ_{\rm D} ρ}/ρ$. Here $κ_{\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $ρ$ is the dist...

### [Site-Order Optimization in the Density Matrix Renormalization Group via Multi-Site Rearrangement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22021v1)
**Authors:** Ryo Watanabe, Toshiya Hikihara, Hiroshi Ueda  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In the approaches based on matrix-product states (MPSs), such as the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, the ordering of the sites crucially affects the computational accuracy. We investigate the performance of an algorithm that searches for the optimal site order by iterative local site rearrangement. We improve the algorithm by expanding the range of site rearrangement and apply ...

### [Fluctuations and Irreversibility: Historical and Modern Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22011v1)
**Authors:** Sounak Bandyopadhyay, Arnab Ghosh  
**Published:** 2025-12-26  
**Updated:** 2025-12-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** This article traces the development of fluctuation theory and its deep connection to irreversibility, from equilibrium to near-equilibrium, and finally to far-from-equilibrium systems. Classical fluctuation theorems, which capture the statistical behaviour of thermodynamic systems far from equilibrium, are now well established. Their quantum counterparts, however, remain an active area of research...
