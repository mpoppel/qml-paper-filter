### [Mapping Post-Training Forgetting in Language Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17776v1)
**Authors:** Jackson Harmon, Andreas Hochlehnert, Matthias Bethge et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-20  
**Updated:** 2025-10-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. ...

**Abstract:** This paper presents low-complexity tensor completion algorithms and their efficient implementation to reconstruct highly oscillatory operators discretized as $n\times n$ matrices. The underlying tensor decomposition is based on the reshaping of the input matrix and its butterfly decomposition into an order $\mathcal{O} (\log n)$ tensor. The reshaping of the input matrix into a tensor allows for re...

**Updated:** 2025-10-19  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time,...
