### [Iterative Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier-enhanced Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19399v1)
**Authors:** Yulun Wu, Miguel Aguiar, Karl H. Johansson et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency components through Random Fou...

**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In this paper, we address the challenge of multivariate time-series forecasting using quantum machine learning techniques. We introduce adaptation strategies that extend variational quantum circuit models, traditionally limited to univariate data, toward the multivariate setting, exploring both purely quantum and hybrid quantum-classical formulations. First, we extend and benchmark several VQC-bas...

### [Probing Sensitivity near a Quantum Exceptional Point using Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21554v1)
**Authors:** Aziza Almanakly, Reouven Assouly, Harry Hanlim Kang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with complex eigenenergies are useful tools for describing the dynamics of open quantum systems. In particular, parity and time (\PT) symmetric Hamiltonians have generated interest due to the emergence of exceptional-point degeneracies, where both eigenenergies and eigenvectors coalesce as the energy spectrum transitions from real- to complex-valued. Because of the abrup...

### [Compositional Generation for Long-Horizon Coupled PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20141v1)
**Authors:** Somayajulu L. N. Dhulipala, Deep Ray, Nicholas Forman  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled) data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the coupled field. Specifically, we inv...

### [On the Structure of Stationary Solutions to McKean-Vlasov Equations with Applications to Noisy Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20094v1)
**Authors:** Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Sayan Banerjee, Philippe Rigollet  
**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23

**Abstract:** We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This f...

**Abstract:** Natural gradient is an advanced optimization method based on information geometry, where the Fisher metric plays a crucial role.   Its quantum counterpart, known as quantum natural gradient (QNG), employs the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) metric, one of the quantum Fisher metrics.   While quantization in physics is typically well-defined via the canonical commutation relations, the quanti...

### [Equivariance by Contrast: Identifiable Equivariant Embeddings from Unlabeled Finite Group Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21706v1)
**Authors:** Tobias Schmidt, Steffen Schneider, Matthias Bethge  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We propose Equivariance by Contrast (EbC) to learn equivariant embeddings from observation pairs $(\mathbf{y}, g \cdot \mathbf{y})$, where $g$ is drawn from a finite group acting on the data. Our method jointly learns a latent space and a group representation in which group actions correspond to invertible linear maps -- without relying on group-specific inductive biases. We validate our approach ...

### [Fundamental impossibility of a superradiant neutrino laser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21705v1)
**Authors:** Yu-Kun Lu, Hanzhen Lin, Wolfgang Ketterle  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.atom-ph  

**Abstract:** Here we address the fundamental question whether an idealized system of $N$ atoms will show collective behavior and superradiance when it emits fermions instead of photons. We show that the maximum emission is $\propto N$ and not $\propto N^2$ which proves the absence of superradiance and shows that the recent proposal to realize a superradiant neutrino laser is impossible. This can be understood ...

### [Visual Diffusion Models are Geometric Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21697v1)
**Authors:** Nir Goren, Shai Yehezkel, Omer Dahary et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** In this paper we show that visual diffusion models can serve as effective geometric solvers: they can directly reason about geometric problems by working in pixel space. We first demonstrate this on the Inscribed Square Problem, a long-standing problem in geometry that asks whether every Jordan curve contains four points forming a square. We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard ge...

**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The coordination of autonomous agents in dynamic environments is hampered by the semantic gap between high-level mission objectives and low-level planner inputs. To address this, we introduce a framework centered on a Knowledge Graph (KG) that functions as an intelligent translation layer. The KG's two-plane architecture compiles declarative facts into per-agent, mission-aware ``worldviews" and ph...

**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Neural networks have advanced combinatorial optimization, with Transformer-based solvers achieving near-optimal solutions on the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) in milliseconds. However, these models operate as black boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by applying sparse autoencoders (SA...

**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.atom-ph  

**Abstract:** This paper lays out the principles of how Bose-Einstein condensates can modify radioactive decay. We highlight the challenges of many modes and short coherence times due to the $\approx$ MeV energies of the emitted radiation. Recent proposals for gamma ray and neutrino lasers claim that using a Bose-Einstein condensate as a source would solve these issues. We show that this is not the case, and th...

**Abstract:** Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between equivariance and model...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** An elementary particle such as a photon cannot be cut in two pieces. Still it must be possible to truncate a photon with an optical shutter. The result is not another photon or a mix of a photon and a vacuum. Instead it is a superposition and mix of photon numbers up to infinity. This state is rather complicated, but nevertheless locally equivalent to a single photon or vacuum in disjoint regions....

**Abstract:** We introduce a prototype FPGA decoder implementing the recently discovered Relay-BP algorithm and targeting memory experiments on the $[[144,12,12]]$ bivariate bicycle quantum low-density parity check code. The decoder is both fast and accurate, achieving a belief propagation iteration time of 24ns. It matches the logical error performance of a floating-point implementation despite using reduced p...

**Abstract:** Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expre...

### [Fisher meets Feynman: score-based variational inference with a product of experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21598v1)
**Authors:** Diana Cai, Robert M. Gower, David M. Blei et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-24

**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them for BBVI, we must be a...

### [On the Schrödinger and Carroll Schrödinger Equations: Dualities and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21597v1)
**Authors:** José Rojas, Enrique Casanova, Melvin Arias  
**Published:** 2025-10-24  
**Updated:** 2025-10-24  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate precise structural relations between the standard Schr\"odinger equation and its Carrollian analogue-the Carroll-Schr\"odinger equation-in 1+1 dimensions, with emphasis on dualities, potential maps, and solution behavior. Our contributions proceed in the order of the paper: (i) we encode both dynamics with operators $H$ and $F$ under external potentials and explore conditions for ob...

**Abstract:** Multi-period stock-keeping unit (SKU) allocation in supply chains is a combinatorial optimization problem that is both NP-hard and operationally critical, requiring simultaneous attention to profitability, feasibility, and diversity. Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) provides a principled framework for such tasks, yet prior studies often rely on simplified assumptions or omit real...

**Abstract:** The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for V...

### [On Biologically Plausible Learning in Continuous Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18808v1)
**Authors:** Marc Gong Bacvanski, Liu Ziyin, Tomaso Poggio  
**Published:** 2025-10-21  
**Updated:** 2025-10-21  
**Categories:** cs.LG, q-bio.NC  

**Abstract:** Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback alignment (DFA...

**Abstract:** Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) leverages the high-dimensional, nonlinear dynamics inherent in quantum many-body systems for extracting spatiotemporal patterns in sequential and time-series data with minimal training overhead. Although QRC inherits the expressive capabilities associated with quantum encodings, recent studies indicate that quantum classifiers based on variational circuits remain ...
