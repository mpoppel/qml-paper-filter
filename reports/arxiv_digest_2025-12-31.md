### [Heisenberg-limited metrology from the quantum-quench dynamics of an anisotropic ferromagnet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23606v1)
**Authors:** Z. M. McIntyre, Ji Zou, Jelena Klinovaja et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The emerging field of quantum magnonics seeks to understand and harness the quantum properties of magnons -- quantized collective spin excitations in magnets. Squeezed magnon states arise naturally as the equilibrium ground states of anisotropic ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, representing an important class of nonclassical magnon states. In this work, we show how a qubit-conditioned quantum qu...

### [Random Controlled Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23670v1)
**Authors:** Francesco Piatti, Thomas Cass, William F. Turner  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We introduce a training-efficient framework for time-series learning that combines random features with controlled differential equations (CDEs). In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations. Only a linear readout layer is trained, resulting in fast, scalable models with strong inductive bias. Building on this fo...

### [Quantum Geometric Bounds in Non-Hermitian Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23708v1)
**Authors:** Milosz Matraszek, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Jan Behrends  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We identify quantum geometric bounds for observables in non-Hermitian systems. We find unique bounds on non-Hermitian quantum geometric tensors, generalized two-point response correlators, conductivity tensors, and optical weights. We showcase these findings in topological systems with non-Hermitian Chern numbers. We demonstrate that the non-Hermitian geometric constraints on response functions na...

### [Training AI Co-Scientists Using Rubric Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23707v1)
**Authors:** Shashwat Goel, Rishi Hazra, Dulhan Jayalath et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL, cs.HC  

**Abstract:** AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research ...

### [Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23706v1)
**Authors:** Saranesh Prembabu, Shu-Heng Shao, Ruben Verresen  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their bo...

### [The operational no-signalling constraints and their implications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23702v1)
**Authors:** Michał Eckstein, Tomasz Miller, Ryszard Horodecki et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** quant-ph, gr-qc  

**Abstract:** The study of quantum correlations within relativistic spacetimes, and the consequences of relativistic causality on information processing using such correlations, has gained much attention in recent years. In this paper, we establish a unified framework in the form of operational no-signalling constraints to study both nonlocal and temporal correlations within general relativistic spacetimes. We ...

### [Eliciting Behaviors in Multi-Turn Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23701v1)
**Authors:** Jing Huang, Shujian Zhang, Lun Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Identifying specific and often complex behaviors from large language models (LLMs) in conversational settings is crucial for their evaluation. Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversa...

### [Bellman Calibration for V-Learning in Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23694v1)
**Authors:** Lars van der Laan, Nathan Kallus  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, econ.EM  

**Abstract:** We introduce Iterated Bellman Calibration, a simple, model-agnostic, post-hoc procedure for calibrating off-policy value predictions in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibrati...

### [Multilingual Hidden Prompt Injection Attacks on LLM-Based Academic Reviewing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23684v1)
**Authors:** Panagiotis Theocharopoulos, Ajinkya Kulkarni, Mathew Magimai. -Doss  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered for use in high-impact workflows, including academic peer review. However, LLMs are vulnerable to document-level hidden prompt injection attacks. In this work, we construct a dataset of approximately 500 real academic papers accepted to ICML and evaluate the effect of embedding hidden adversarial prompts within these documents. Each paper is...

### [Web World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23676v1)
**Authors:** Jichen Feng, Yifan Zhang, Chenggong Zhang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model ...

### [End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23675v1)
**Authors:** Arnuv Tandon, Karan Dalal, Xinhao Li et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the mo...

### [Calibrated Multi-Level Quantile Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23671v1)
**Authors:** Tiffany Ding, Isaac Gibbs, Ryan J. Tibshirani  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, math.OC, stat.ME  

**Abstract:** We present an online method for guaranteeing calibration of quantile forecasts at multiple quantile levels simultaneously. A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecas...

### [Ordering-Independent Wheeler-DeWitt Equation for Flat Minisuperspace Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23656v1)
**Authors:** Victor Franken, Eftychios Kaimakkamis, Hervé Partouche et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** hep-th, gr-qc, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We consider minisuperspace models with quadratic kinetic terms, assuming a flat target space and a closed Universe. We show that, upon canonical quantization of the Hamiltonian, only a restricted subset of operator orderings is consistent with the path-integral viewpoint. Remarkably, all consistent orderings are physically equivalent to all orders in $\hbar$. Specifically, each choice of path-inte...

### [Simultaneous Approximation of the Score Function and Its Derivatives by Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23643v1)
**Authors:** Konstantin Yakovlev, Nikita Puchkin  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.LG, math.ST, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We present a theory for simultaneous approximation of the score function and its derivatives, enabling the handling of data distributions with low-dimensional structure and unbounded support. Our approximation error bounds match those in the literature while relying on assumptions that relax the usual bounded support requirement. Crucially, our bounds are free from the curse of dimensionality. Mor...

### [Gauge-Invariant Phase Mapping to Intensity Lobes of Structured Light via Closed-Loop Atomic Dark States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23642v1)
**Authors:** Nayan Sharma, Ajay Tripathi  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We present an analytical model showing how the gauge-invariant loop phase in a three-level closed-loop atomic system imprints as bright-dark lobes in Laguerre Gaussian probe beam intensity patterns. In the weak probe limit, the output intensity in such systems include Beer-Lambert absorption, a scattering term and loop phase dependent interference term with optical depth controlling visibility. Th...

**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.CY, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** One-to-one tutoring is widely considered the gold standard for personalized education, yet it remains prohibitively expensive to scale. To evaluate whether generative AI might help expand access to this resource, we conducted an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with $N = 165$ students across five UK secondary schools. We integrated LearnLM -- a generative AI model fine-tuned for pedag...

### [BOAD: Discovering Hierarchical Software Engineering Agents via Bandit Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23631v1)
**Authors:** Iris Xu, Guangtao Zeng, Zexue He et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolith...

### [Memorization in 3D Shape Generation: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23628v1)
**Authors:** Shu Pu, Boya Zeng, Kaichen Zhou et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Generative models are increasingly used in 3D vision to synthesize novel shapes, yet it remains unclear whether their generation relies on memorizing training shapes. Understanding their memorization could help prevent training data leakage and improve the diversity of generated results. In this paper, we design an evaluation framework to quantify memorization in 3D generative models and study the...

### [Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Device and Circuit Modeling: A Case Study of NeuroSPICE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23624v1)
**Authors:** Chien-Ting Tung, Chenming Hu  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** cs.AI, physics.app-ph  

**Abstract:** We present NeuroSPICE, a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for device and circuit simulation. Unlike conventional SPICE, which relies on time-discretized numerical solvers, NeuroSPICE leverages PINNs to solve circuit differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) by minimizing the residual of the equations through backpropagation. It models device and circuit waveforms using analytical equ...

### [Paradox-free classical non-causality and unambiguous non-locality without entanglement are equivalent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23599v1)
**Authors:** Hippolyte Dourdent, Kyrylo Simonov, Andreas Leitherer et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Closed timelike curves (CTCs) challenge our conception of causality by allowing information to loop back into its own past. Any consistent description of such scenarios must avoid time-travel paradoxes while respecting the no-new-physics principle, which requires that the set of operations available within any local spacetime region remain unchanged, irrespective of whether CTCs exist elsewhere. W...

### [Averaging of quantum channels via channel-state duality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23586v1)
**Authors:** Marcin Markiewicz, Łukasz Pawela, Zbigniew Puchała  
**Published:** 2025-12-29  
**Updated:** 2025-12-29  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Twirling, uniform averaging over symmetry actions, is a standard tool for reducing the description of quantum states and channels to symmetry-invariant data. We develop a framework for averaging quantum channels based on channel-state duality that converts pre- and post-processing averages into a group twirl acting directly on the Choi operator. For arbitrary unitary representations on the input a...
