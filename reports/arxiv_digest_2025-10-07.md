**Authors:** Muhao Guo, Yang Weng  
**Published:** 2025-10-05  
**Updated:** 2025-10-05  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Neural ODEs (NODEs) have emerged as powerful tools for modeling time series data, offering the flexibility to adapt to varying input scales and capture complex dynamics. However, they face significant challenges: first, their reliance on time-domain representations often limits their ability to capture long-term dependencies and periodic structures; second, the inherent mismatch between their cont...

**Abstract:** Semiautomata form a rich class of sequence-processing algorithms with applications in natural language processing, robotics, computational biology, and data mining. We establish the first Statistical Query hardness result for semiautomata under the uniform distribution over input words and initial states. We show that Statistical Query hardness can be established when both the alphabet size and in...

**Updated:** 2025-10-01  
**Categories:** cs.LG, physics.comp-ph, physics.data-an, physics.geo-ph

While conventional methods require several seconds of data, we present a neural network approach capable of reconstructing frequencies of several hundred Hertz within approximately 10 milliseconds. This e...

### [Feature Identification via the Empirical NTK](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00468v1)
**Authors:** Jennifer Lin  
**Published:** 2025-10-01  
**Updated:** 2025-10-01  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel (eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with ground-truth features. In...

### [Efficient Quantum Hermite Transform](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04929v1)
**Authors:** Siddhartha Jain, Vishnu Iyer, Rolando D. Somma et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** We present a new primitive for quantum algorithms that implements a discrete Hermite transform efficiently, in time that depends logarithmically in both the dimension and the inverse of the allowable error. This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm...

### [Closed-Form Last Layer Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04606v1)
**Authors:** Alexandre Galashov, Nathaël Da Costa, Liyuan Xu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters, and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to alternating bet...

### [One rig to control them all](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05032v1)
**Authors:** Chris Heunen, Robin Kaarsgaard, Louis Lemonnier  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** cs.LO, math.CT, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce a theory for computational control, consisting of seven naturally interpretable equations. Adding these to a prop of base circuits constructs controlled circuits, borne out in examples of reversible Boolean circuits and quantum circuits. We prove that this syntactic construction semantically corresponds to taking the free rig category on the base prop.

**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The technique of combining multiple votes to enhance the quality of a decision is the core of boosting algorithms in machine learning. In particular, boosting provably increases decision quality by combining multiple weak learners-hypotheses that are only slightly better than random guessing-into a single strong learner that classifies data well. There exist various versions of boosting algorithms...

### [Correcting quantum errors using a classical code and one additional qubit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05008v1)
**Authors:** Tenzan Araki, Joseph F. Goodwin, Zhenyu Cai  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-proce...

**Abstract:** In this work, we study the hardness required to achieve proofs of quantumness (PoQ), which in turn capture (potentially interactive) quantum advantage. A ``trivial'' PoQ is to simply assume an average-case hard problem for classical computers that is easy for quantum computers. However, there is much interest in ``non-trivial'' PoQ that actually rely on quantum hardness assumptions, as these are o...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** The asymmetry between heating and cooling in open quantum systems is a hallmark of nonequilibrium dynamics, yet its thermodynamic origin has remained unclear. Here, we investigate the thermalization of a quantum system weakly coupled to a thermal bath, focusing on the entropy production rate and the quantum thermokinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR). We derive an analytical expression for the entro...

**Abstract:** Conformal prediction offers a powerful framework for building distribution-free prediction intervals for exchangeable data. Existing methods that extend conformal prediction to sequential data rely on fitting a relatively complex model to capture temporal dependencies. However, these methods can fail if the sample size is small and often require expensive retraining when the underlying data distri...

**Abstract:** We present a categorical framework for relating causal models that represent the same system at different levels of abstraction. We define a causal abstraction as natural transformations between appropriate Markov functors, which concisely consolidate desirable properties a causal abstraction should exhibit. Our approach unifies and generalizes previously considered causal abstractions, and we obt...

**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** One of the most fundamental problems in the field of hypothesis testing is the identity testing problem: whether samples from some unknown distribution $\mathcal{G}$ are actually from some explicit distribution $\mathcal{D}$. It is known that when the distribution $\mathcal{D}$ has support $[N]$, the optimal sample complexity for the identity testing problem is roughly $O(\sqrt{N})$. However, many...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Most existing approximate Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithms for multi-armed bandits use Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) or its variants in each round to sample from the posterior, relaxing the need for conjugacy assumptions between priors and reward distributions in vanilla TS. However, they often require approximating a different posterior distribution in different round of the bandi...

**Abstract:** The Clifford hierarchy is a fundamental structure in quantum computation whose mathematical properties are not fully understood. In this work, we characterize permutation gates -- unitaries which permute the $2^n$ basis states -- in the third level of the hierarchy. We prove that any permutation gate in the third level must be a product of Toffoli gates in what we define as \emph{staircase form}, ...
