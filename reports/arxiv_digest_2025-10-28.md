### [Iterative Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier-enhanced Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19399v1)
**Authors:** Yulun Wu, Miguel Aguiar, Karl H. Johansson et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency components through Random Fou...

### [Lookahead Anchoring: Preserving Character Identity in Audio-Driven Human Animation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23581v1)
**Authors:** Junyoung Seo, Rodrigo Mira, Alexandros Haliassos et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-27  
**Updated:** 2025-10-27  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address this, we propose Looka...

**Abstract:** We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equations on the circle. Our main contributions stem from observing an exact equivalence between solutions of the stationary McKean-Vlasov equation and an infinite-dimensional quadratic system of equations over Fourier coefficients, which allows explicit characterization of the stationary states in a sequence space rather than a function space. This f...

**Published:** 2025-10-23  
**Updated:** 2025-10-23  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled) data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the coupled field. Specifically, we inv...

### [The Enigma of Delayed Choice Quantum Eraser](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23539v1)
**Authors:** Tabish Qureshi  
**Published:** 2025-10-27  
**Updated:** 2025-10-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The delayed-choice quantum eraser represents an interesting experiment that exemplifies Bohr's principle of complementarity in a beautiful way. According to the complementarity principle, in a two-path interference experiment, the knowledge of which path was taken by the particle and the appearance of interference are mutually exclusive. Even when the which-path information is merely retained in s...

**Authors:** Yakov Solomons, Roni Ben-Maimon, Arpit Behera et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-27  
**Updated:** 2025-10-27  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a practical approach for interfacing light with a two-dimensional atomic tweezer array. Typical paraxial fields are poorly matched to the array's multi-diffraction-order radiation pattern, thus severely limiting the interface coupling efficiency. Instead, we propose to design a field mode that naturally couples to the array: it consists of a unique superposition of multiple beams corres...
