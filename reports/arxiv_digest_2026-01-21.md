### [Native linear-optical protocol for efficient multivariate trace estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14204v1)
**Authors:** Leonardo Novo, Marco Robbio, Ernesto F. Galvão et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The Hong-Ou-Mandel test estimates the overlap between spectral functions characterizing the internal degrees of freedom of two single photons. It can be viewed as a photon-native protocol that implements the well-known quantum SWAP test. Here, we propose a native linear-optical protocol that efficiently estimates multivariate traces of quantum states called Bargmann invariants, which are ubiquitou...

### [Spatiotemporal Wildfire Prediction and Reinforcement Learning for Helitack Suppression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14238v1)
**Authors:** Shaurya Mathur, Shreyas Bellary Manjunath, Nitin Kulkarni et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Wildfires are growing in frequency and intensity, devastating ecosystems and communities while causing billions of dollars in suppression costs and economic damage annually in the U.S. Traditional wildfire management is mostly reactive, addressing fires only after they are detected. We introduce \textit{FireCastRL}, a proactive artificial intelligence (AI) framework that combines wildfire forecast...

### [Q-learning with Adjoint Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14234v1)
**Authors:** Qiyang Li, Sergey Levine  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to d...

### [Group Fourier filtering of quantum resources in quantum phase space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14225v1)
**Authors:** Luke Coffman, N. L. Diaz, Martin Larocca et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Recently, it has been shown that group Fourier analysis of quantum states, i.e., decomposing them into the irreducible representations (irreps) of a symmetry group, enables new ways to characterize their resourcefulness. Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis cha...

### [The $O(n\to\infty)$ Rotor Model and the Quantum Spherical Model on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14119v1)
**Authors:** Nikita Titov, Andrea Trombettoni  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We show that the large $n$ limit of the $O(n)$ quantum rotor model defined on a general graph has the same critical behavior as the corresponding quantum spherical model and that the critical exponents depend solely on the spectral dimension $d_s$ of the graph. To this end, we employ a classical to quantum mapping and use known results for the large $n$ limit of the classical $O(n)$ model on graph...

### [Quantum Pontus-Mpemba Effect Enabled by the Liouvillian Skin Effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14083v1)
**Authors:** Stefano Longhi  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn  

**Abstract:** We unveil a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect enabled by the Liouvillian skin effect in a dissipative tight-binding chain with asymmetric incoherent hopping and coherent boundary coupling. The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relax...

### [Localizable Entanglement as an Order Parameter for Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14185v1)
**Authors:** Sourav Manna, Arul Lakshminarayan, Vaibhav Madhok  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** We identify localizable entanglement (LE) as an order parameter for measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPT). LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to b...

**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum memories are key components of emerging quantum technologies. They are designed to store quantum states and retrieve them on demand without losing features such as superposition and entanglement. Verifying that a memory preserves these features is indispensable for applications such as quantum computation, cryptography and networks, yet no general and assumption-free method has been availa...

### [Sharp Inequalities for Schur-Convex Functionals of Partial Traces over Unitary Orbits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14158v1)
**Authors:** Pablo Costa Rico, Pavel Shteyner  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** While many bounds have been proved for partial trace inequalities over the last decades for a large variety of quantities, recent problems in quantum information theory demand sharper bounds. In this work, we study optimal bounds for partial trace quantities in terms of the spectrum; equivalently, we determine the best bounds attainable over unitary orbits of matrices. We solve this question for S...

**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Generalizing video matting models to real-world videos remains a significant challenge due to the scarcity of labeled data. To address this, we present Video Mask-to-Matte Model (VideoMaMa) that converts coarse segmentation masks into pixel accurate alpha mattes, by leveraging pretrained video diffusion models. VideoMaMa demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization to real-world footage, even thou...

### [Jet-RL: Enabling On-Policy FP8 Reinforcement Learning with Unified Training and Rollout Precision Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14243v1)
**Authors:** Haocheng Xi, Charlie Ruan, Peiyuan Liao et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) is essential for enhancing the complex reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottle...

**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** astro-ph.IM, astro-ph.CO, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will produce unprecedented volumes of heterogeneous astronomical data (images, catalogs, and alerts) that challenge traditional analysis pipelines. The LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) aims to derive robust constraints on dark energy and dark matter from these data, requiring methods that are statistically powerful...

### [KAGE-Bench: Fast Known-Axis Visual Generalization Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14232v1)
**Authors:** Egor Cherepanov, Daniil Zelezetsky, Alexey K. Kovalev et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying c...

### [InT: Self-Proposed Interventions Enable Credit Assignment in LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14209v1)
**Authors:** Matthew Y. R. Yang, Hao Bai, Ian Wu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Outcome-reward reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective at improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in faile...

**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Inspecting the undercarriage of used vehicles is a labor-intensive task that requires inspectors to crouch or crawl underneath each vehicle to thoroughly examine it. Additionally, online buyers rarely see undercarriage photos. We present an end-to-end pipeline that utilizes a three-camera rig to capture videos of the undercarriage as the vehicle drives over it, and produces an interactive 3D model...

### [Locality forces equal energy spacing of quantum many-body scar towers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14206v1)
**Authors:** Nicholas O'Dea, Lei Gioia, Sanjay Moudgalya et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** Quantum many-body scars are non-thermal eigenstates embedded in the spectra of otherwise non-integrable Hamiltonians. Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local "parent" Hamiltonians for which they are exac...

**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Pickup points are widely recognized as a sustainable alternative to home delivery, as consolidating orders at pickup locations can shorten delivery routes and improve first-attempt success rates. However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from deli...

### [Penalizing Localized Dirichlet Energies in Low Rank Tensor Products](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14173v1)
**Authors:** Paris A. Karakasis, Nicholas D. Sidiropoulos  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We study low-rank tensor-product B-spline (TPBS) models for regression tasks and investigate Dirichlet energy as a measure of smoothness. We show that TPBS models admit a closed-form expression for the Dirichlet energy, and reveal scenarios where perfect interpolation is possible with exponentially small Dirichlet energy. This renders global Dirichlet energy-based regularization ineffective. To ad...

### [Human Values in a Single Sentence: Moral Presence, Hierarchies, and Transformer Ensembles on the Schwartz Continuum](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14172v1)
**Authors:** Víctor Yeste, Paolo Rosso  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We study sentence-level identification of the 19 values in the Schwartz motivational continuum as a concrete formulation of human value detection in text. The setting - out-of-context sentences from news and political manifestos - features sparse moral cues and severe class imbalance. This combination makes fine-grained sentence-level value detection intrinsically difficult, even for strong modern...

**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** Understanding the entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems under steady-state transport conditions is an actively pursued challenging topic. Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progr...

### [Generalised contextuality of continuous variable quantum theory can be revealed with a single projective measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14067v1)
**Authors:** Pauli Jokinen, Mirjam Weilenmann, Martin Plávala et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-20  
**Updated:** 2026-01-20  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** Generalized contextuality is a possible indicator of non-classical behaviour in quantum information theory. In finite-dimensional systems, this is justified by the fact that noncontextual theories can be embedded into some simplex, i.e. into a classical theory. We show that a direct application of the standard definition of generalized contextuality to continuous variable systems does not envelope...
