### [Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116v1)
**Authors:** Sarod Yatawatta  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** astro-ph.IM, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky.   Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geome...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long, physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative, enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO approximation ...

**Published:** 2025-10-17  
**Updated:** 2025-10-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** We investigate the spectral properties of all-to-all interacting spin Hamiltonians acting on exactly $k$ spins whose coupling coefficients are drawn from a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. For the completely disordered case $\mu = 0$, we show that the universality class of level statistics depends solely on the parity of system size $L$ and locality $k$, classifying the...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, math.OC  

**Abstract:** Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems. However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance between classical...

**Abstract:** The out of equilibrium dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (SYK), comprising $N$ Majoranas with random all-to-all four-body interactions, minimally coupled to a Markovian bath modeled by the Lindblad formalism, displays intriguing nontrivial features. In particular, the decay rate towards the steady state is a non-monotonic function of the bath coupling $\mu$, and an analogue of the Loschmidt ...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Hybrid encodings, where multiple degrees of freedom are used to encode quantum information, can increase the size of the Hilbert space with minimal increase to hardware requirements. We show a reprogrammable integrated photonic device, with multimodal components designed to allow for control over the transverse electric modes. We use this device to generate qudit states entangled in the path and t...

### [A source of heralded atom-photon entanglement for quantum networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15765v1)
**Authors:** Gianvito Chiarella, Tobias Frank, Leart Zuka et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-17  
**Updated:** 2025-10-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Communication in quantum networks suffers notoriously from photon loss. Resulting errors can be mitigated with a suitable measurement herald at the receiving node. However, waiting for a herald and communicating the measurement result back to the sender in a repeat-until-success strategy makes the protocol slow and prone to errors from false heralds such as detector dark counts. Here we implement ...

**Updated:** 2025-10-17  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mtrl-sci  

**Abstract:** Geometry and topology are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics, but their precise connection in quantum systems remains incompletely understood. Here, we develop an analytical scheme for calculating the curvature of the quantum metric of Bloch bands. Using a gauge-invariant formulation based on eigenprojectors, we construct the full Riemannian geometry of the quantum-state manifold and a...

**Abstract:** A homogeneous and isotropic quantum cosmological system (universe) initially filled with a uniform scalar field that has a potential in the power law representation is considered. Depending on the epoch, this scalar field yields barotropic matter in the form of stiff matter, perfect gas, radiation, dust, cosmic strings, domain walls, de Sitter vacuum, or phantom matter. The proposed approach is ba...

**Abstract:** The decoherence of superpositions of classically distinguishable states (cat states) is crucial for understanding quantum-to-classical transitions and quantum measurements. So far, decoherence processes of mesoscopic cat states have been demonstrated in several experiments. However, the issue of how the unitary system-reservoir dynamics can lead to irreversible system decoherence remains largely u...

**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.AR, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Current transformer accelerators primarily focus on optimizing self-attention due to its quadratic complexity. However, this focus is less relevant for vision transformers with short token lengths, where the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) tends to be the dominant computational bottleneck. This paper presents a low power Vision Transformer accelerator, optimized through algorithm-hardware co-design. Th...

### [On efficiently computable functions, deep networks and sparse compositionality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11942v1)
**Authors:** Tomaso Poggio  
**Published:** 2025-10-13  
**Updated:** 2025-10-13  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse} (bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if $f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mat...

**Abstract:** Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning. To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under Discourse Rel...
