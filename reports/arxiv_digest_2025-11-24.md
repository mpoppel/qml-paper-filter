### [Primitive Quantum Gates for an $SU(3)$ Discrete Subgroup: $Σ(72\times3)$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17437v1)
**Authors:** Sebastian Osorio Perez, Edison M. Murairi, Erik J. Gustafson et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** hep-lat, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We construct a primitive gate set for the digital quantum simulation of a discrete subgroup of $SU(3)$: the 216-element $Σ(72\times3)$. The necessary primitives are the inversion gate, the group multiplication gate, the trace gate, and the group Fourier transform, for which we provide qubit decompositions. The resulting fault-tolerant T gate costs for a fiducial calculation of shear viscosity woul...

### [Entanglement and correlations between local observables in de Sitter spacetime](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17382v1)
**Authors:** Patricia Ribes-Metidieri, Ivan Agullo, Béatrice Bonga  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** gr-qc, hep-th, math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Studies of quantum field entanglement in de Sitter space based on the von Neumann entropy of local patches have concluded that curvature enhances entanglement between regions and their complements. Similar conclusions about entanglement enhancement have been reached in analyses of Fourier modes in the cosmological patch of de Sitter space. We challenge this interpretation by adopting a fully local...

### [Exploring fixed points and eigenstates of quantum systems with reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17491v1)
**Authors:** María Laura Olivera-Atencio, Jesús Casado-Pascual, Denis Lacroix  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce a reinforcement learning algorithm designed to identify the fixed points of a given quantum operation. The method iteratively constructs the unitary transformation that maps the computational basis onto the basis of fixed points through a reward-penalty scheme based on quantum measurements. In cases where the operation corresponds to a Hamiltonian evolution, this task reduces to deter...

**Authors:** Yuejie Xin, Sean L. M. van der Meer, Marc Serra-Peralta et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Leakage to non-computational states is a source of correlated errors in both time and space that limits the effectiveness of quantum error correction (QEC) with superconducting circuits. We present and experimentally demonstrate a high-fidelity, leakage reduction unit (LRU) operating concurrently with transmon measurement without incurring time overhead. Adapted from double-drive reset of populati...

### [Quantum Masked Autoencoders for Vision Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17372v1)
**Authors:** Emma Andrews, Prabhat Mishra  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Classical autoencoders are widely used to learn features of input data. To improve the feature learning, classical masked autoencoders extend classical autoencoders to learn the features of the original input sample in the presence of masked-out data. While quantum autoencoders exist, there is no design and implementation of quantum masked autoencoders that can leverage the benefits of quantum com...

**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cond-mat.quant-gas, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Edge states of chiral topologically ordered phases are commonly described by chiral Luttinger liquids, effective theories that are exact only in the hydrodynamic limit. Motivated by recent bulk observations of fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) in two-dimensional materials and by synthetic realizations in ultracold atoms, we revisit this framework and quantify deviations from the hydrodynamic limi...

**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** cs.LG, eess.SY, math.OC  

**Abstract:** It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regu...

### [Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17476v1)
**Authors:** Himadri Halder  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting i...

### [Addressing A Posteriori Performance Degradation in Neural Network Subgrid Stress Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17475v1)
**Authors:** Andy Wu, Sanjiva K. Lele  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** physics.flu-dyn, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Neural network subgrid stress models often have a priori performance that is far better than the a posteriori performance, leading to neural network models that look very promising a priori completely failing in a posteriori Large Eddy Simulations (LES). This performance gap can be decreased by combining two different methods, training data augmentation and reducing input complexity to the neural ...

**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rathe...

**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared repr...

**Abstract:** We consider the adaptive control problem for discrete-time, nonlinear stochastic systems with linearly parameterised uncertainty. Assuming access to a parameterised family of controllers that can stabilise the system in a bounded set within an informative region of the state space when the parameter is well-chosen, we propose a certainty equivalence learning-based adaptive control strategy, and su...

### [Self-Supervised Learning by Curvature Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17426v1)
**Authors:** Benyamin Ghojogh, M. Hadi Sepanj, Paul Fieguth  
**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently advanced through non-contrastive methods that couple an invariance term with variance, covariance, or redundancy-reduction penalties. While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized sel...

**Published:** 2025-11-21  
**Updated:** 2025-11-21  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Deep learning models are prone to learning shortcut solutions to problems using spuriously correlated yet irrelevant features of their training data. In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different...

This criterion yields quantitative...

**Abstract:** We develop a geometric description of quantum light in photonic time crystals on the SU(1,1) coherent-state manifold. In a projective picture, the evolution of each mode appears as a Möbius isometry on the Poincaré disk, where topologies of trajectories distinguish stable, unstable, and critical regimes. The geometric phase is related to the hyperbolic area enclosed by cyclic paths in the complex ...
