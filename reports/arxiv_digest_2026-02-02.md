### [Decoupled Diffusion Sampling for Inverse Problems on Function Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23280v1)
**Authors:** Thomas Y. L. Lin, Jiachen Yao, Lufang Chiang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.NA  

**Abstract:** We propose a data-efficient, physics-aware generative framework in function space for inverse PDE problems. Existing plug-and-play diffusion posterior samplers represent physics implicitly through joint coefficient-solution modeling, requiring substantial paired supervision. In contrast, our Decoupled Diffusion Inverse Solver (DDIS) employs a decoupled design: an unconditional diffusion learns the...

**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Recent advances in coherent spin shuttling have made sparse semiconductor spin qubit arrays an appealing solid-state platform to realize quantum processors. The dynamic and long-range connectivity enabled by shuttling is also essential for many quantum error-correction (QEC) schemes. Here, we demonstrate a silicon spin-qubit device that comprises a shuttling bus for coherently transporting qubits ...

### [VideoGPA: Distilling Geometry Priors for 3D-Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23286v1)
**Authors:** Hongyang Du, Junjie Ye, Xiaoyan Cong et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** While recent video diffusion models (VDMs) produce visually impressive results, they fundamentally struggle to maintain 3D structural consistency, often resulting in object deformation or spatial drift. We hypothesize that these failures arise because standard denoising objectives lack explicit incentives for geometric coherence. To address this, we introduce VideoGPA (Video Geometric Preference A...

**Authors:** MH Farhadi, Ali Rabiee, Sima Ghafoori et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.HC, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Shared autonomy systems require principled methods for inferring user intent and determining appropriate assistance levels. This is a central challenge in human-robot interaction, where systems must be successful while being mindful of user agency. Previous approaches relied on static blending ratios or separated goal inference from assistance arbitration, leading to suboptimal performance in unst...

### [Robust multiparameter estimation using quantum scrambling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23283v1)
**Authors:** Wenjie Gong, Bingtian Ye, Daniel Mark et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We propose and analyze a versatile and efficient multiparameter quantum sensing protocol, which simultaneously estimates many non-commuting and time-dependent signals that are coherently or incoherently coupled to sensing particles. Even in the presence of control imperfections and readout errors, our approach can detect exponentially many parameters in the system size while maintaining the optima...

### [FOCUS: DLLMs Know How to Tame Their Compute Bound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23278v1)
**Authors:** Kaihua Liang, Xin Tan, An Zhong et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AR, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) offer a compelling alternative to Auto-Regressive models, but their deployment is constrained by high decoding cost. In this work, we identify a key inefficiency in DLLM decoding: while computation is parallelized over token blocks, only a small subset of tokens is decodable at each diffusion step, causing most compute to be wasted on non-decodable tokens. W...

**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are central to applications across quantum information science. Yet, their performance is limited by the effects of disorder and electrodynamic inhomogeneities that are not well understood. By combining DC transport, dark-count measurements, and bias-dependent microwave transmission spectroscopy in the presence of controlled nanoscale disorder intro...

Learning-based denoising is promising, yet progress is hindered by scarce paired training data and the need for physically interpretable and reproducible models in scientific workflows. We propose a ...

### [Analytical topological invariants for 2D non-Hermitian phases using Morse theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23272v1)
**Authors:** Cameron Gibson, Evelyn Tang  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** As energy dissipation and gain are ubiquitous in the real world, such phenomena demand the generalization of Hermitian methods such as the analysis of topological properties for non-Hermitian systems. However, as non-Hermitian systems typically contain more degrees of freedom, this poses a challenge for analytical approaches to understand their topology and invariants. In this work, we analyticall...

**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel inverse reinforcement learning framework using a diffusion-based adaptive lookahead planner (IRL-DAL) for autonomous vehicles. Training begins with imitation from an expert finite state machine (FSM) controller to provide a stable initialization. Environment terms are combined with an IRL discriminator signal to align with expert goals. Reinforcement learning (RL) is th...

**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We study theoretically how high-gain effects affect the measurement outcome of visible signal spectra in undetected photon measurement schemes. We consider two interferometric configurations: firstly, the SU(1,1) interferometer where the idler incurs loss and additional dispersion in between two identical, lossless, squeezers; secondly, the induced coherence interferometer where the idler incurs l...

**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We introduce a guided stochastic sampling method that augments sampling from diffusion models with physics-based guidance derived from partial differential equation (PDE) residuals and observational constraints, ensuring generated samples remain physically admissible. We embed this sampling procedure within a new Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) framework, yielding a scalable generative PDE solver. Ac...

**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The Muon optimizer has demonstrated strong empirical performance in pre-training large language models by performing matrix-level gradient (or momentum) orthogonalization in each layer independently. In this work, we propose TEON, a principled generalization of Muon that extends orthogonalization beyond individual layers by modeling the gradients of a neural network as a structured higher-order te...

### [Agnostic Language Identification and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23258v1)
**Authors:** Mikael Møller Høgsgaard, Chirag Pabbaraju  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Recent works on language identification and generation have established tight statistical rates at which these tasks can be achieved. These works typically operate under a strong realizability assumption: that the input data is drawn from an unknown distribution necessarily supported on some language in a given collection. In this work, we relax this assumption of realizability entirely, and impos...

**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Vision-language models suffer performance degradation under domain shift, limiting real-world applicability. Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a...

### [Complete Hierarchies for the Geometric Measure of Entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23243v1)
**Authors:** Lisa T. Weinbrenner, Albert Rico, Kenneth Goodenough et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In quantum physics, multiparticle systems are described by quantum states acting on tensor products of Hilbert spaces. This product structure leads to the distinction between product states and entangled states; moreover, one can quantify entanglement by considering the distance of a quantum state to the set of product states. The underlying optimization problem occurs frequently in physics and be...

**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.IT, cs.LG, cs.SI, math.ST  

**Abstract:** Graph attention networks (GATs) are widely used and often appear robust to noise in node covariates and edges, yet rigorous statistical guarantees demonstrating a provable advantage of GATs over non-attention graph neural networks~(GNNs) are scarce. We partially address this gap for node regression with graph-based errors-in-variables models under simultaneous covariate and edge corruption: respon...

**Abstract:** Generative learning generates high dimensional data based on low dimensional conditions, also called prompts. Therefore, generative learning algorithms are eligible for solving (Bayesian) inverse problems. In this article we compare a traditional Bayesian inverse approach based on a forward regression model and a prior sampled with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method with three state of the art ge...

**Published:** 2026-01-30  
**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, math.OC, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We propose a variational framework that interprets transformer layers as iterations of an optimization algorithm acting on token embeddings. In this view, self-attention implements a gradient step of an interaction energy, while MLP layers correspond to gradient updates of a potential energy. Standard GPT-style transformers emerge as vanilla gradient descent on the resulting composite objective, i...

**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate the dynamics of Entanglement Hamiltonians (EHs) in dissipative free-fermionic systems using a recent operator-based formulation of the quasiparticle picture. Focusing on gain and loss dissipation, we study the post-quench evolution and derive explicit expressions for the EH at the ballistic scale. In the long-time and weak-dissipation regime, the EH is shown to take the form of a ti...

**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Temporal link prediction in dynamic graphs is a fundamental problem in many real-world systems. Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequent...

**Updated:** 2026-01-30  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.ET, cs.MA  

**Abstract:** While multiagent systems have shown promise for tackling complex tasks via specialization, finetuning multiple agents simultaneously faces two key challenges: (1) credit assignment across agents, and (2) sample efficiency of expensive multiagent rollouts. In this work, we propose finetuning multiagent systems with per-action process rewards from AI feedback (MAPPA) to address both. Through assigni...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although m...

**Abstract:** Pairs of entangled photons are crucial for photonic quantum technologies. The demand for integrability and multi-functionality suggests 'flat' platforms - ultrathin layers and metasurfaces - as sources of photon pairs.
