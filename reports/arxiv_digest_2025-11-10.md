### [The Born Ultimatum: Conditions for Classical Surrogation of Quantum Generative Models with Correlators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01845v1)
**Authors:** Mario Herrero-Gonzalez, Brian Coyle, Kieran McDowall et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-03  
**Updated:** 2025-11-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs) are powerful quantum generative models that sample according to the Born rule, with complexity-theoretic evidence suggesting potential quantum advantages for generative tasks. Here, we identify QCBMs as a quantum Fourier model independently of the loss function. This allows us to apply known dequantization conditions when the optimal quantum distribution is av...

### [Learning Fourier shapes to probe the geometric world of deep neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04970v1)
**Authors:** Jian Wang, Yixing Yong, Haixia Bi et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-07  
**Updated:** 2025-11-07  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry; second, that they are high-f...

**Authors:** S. K. Laha  
**Published:** 2025-11-04  
**Updated:** 2025-11-04  
**Categories:** cs.NE, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Forecasting chaotic time series requires models that can capture the intrinsic geometry of the underlying attractor while remaining computationally efficient. We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that integrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to construct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent architectures. Unlike stand...

**Published:** 2025-11-03  
**Updated:** 2025-11-03  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Faithful yet compact explanations for vision models remain a challenge, as commonly used dense perturbation masks are often fragmented and overfitted, needing careful post-processing. Here, we present a training-free explanation method that replaces dense masks with smooth tunable contours. A star-convex region is parameterized by a truncated Fourier series and optimized under an extremal preserve...

### [Memory-Efficient Training with In-Place FFT Implementation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01385v1)
**Authors:** Xinyu Ding, Bangtian Liu, Siyu Liao et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-03  
**Updated:** 2025-11-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, I.2.6; G.1.2; D.1.3  

**Abstract:** Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) are widely used to reduce memory and computational costs in deep learning. However, existing implementations, including standard FFT and real FFT (rFFT), cannot achieve true in-place computation. In particular, rFFT maps an input of size n to a complex output of size n/2+1, causing dimensional mismatch and requiring additional memory allocation. We propose the first r...

### [Quantum non-Markovian Hatano-Nelson model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05328v1)
**Authors:** Sumit Kumar Jana, Ryo Hanai, Tan Van Vu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-07  
**Updated:** 2025-11-07  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** While considering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians arising in the presence of dissipation, in most cases, the dissipation is taken to be frequency independent. However, this idealization may not always be applicable in experimental settings, where dissipation can be frequency-dependent. Such frequency-dependent dissipation leads to non-Markovian behavior. In this work, we demonstrate how a non-Markovian...

**Abstract:** We construct exact strong zero mode operators (ESZM) in integrable quantum circuits and the spin-1/2 XXZ chain for general open boundary conditions, which break the bulk U(1) symmetry of the time evolution operators. We show that the ESZM is localized around one of the boundaries induces infinite boundary coherence times. Finally we prove that the ESZM becomes spatially non-local under the map tha...

**Updated:** 2025-11-07  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum phase estimation is one of the most important tools in quantum algorithms. It can be made non-adaptive (meaning all applications of the unitary $U_\phi$ happen simultaneously) without using more applications of $U_\phi$, albeit at the expense of using many more qubits. It is also known that there is no advantage for adaptive algorithms in the case where the phase that needs to be estimated...

**Abstract:** We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular, if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$ depend...
