### [Counterdiabatic ADAPT-VQE for molecular simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05973v1)
**Authors:** Diego Tancara, Herbert Díaz-Moraga, Dardo Goyeneche  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Among variational quantum algorithms designed for NISQ devices, ADAPT-VQE stands out for its robustness against barren plateaus, particularly in estimating molecular ground states. On the other hand, counterdiabatic algorithms have shown advantages in both performance and circuit depth when compared to standard adiabatic approaches. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that integrates the ADAP...

### [Manifold limit for the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06025v1)
**Authors:** Johanna Tengler, Christoph Brune, José A. Iglesias  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, math.FA, math.OC  

**Abstract:** We study the discrete-to-continuum consistency of the training of shallow graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) on proximity graphs of sampled point clouds under a manifold assumption. Graph convolution is defined spectrally via the graph Laplacian, whose low-frequency spectrum approximates that of the Laplace-Beltrami operator of the underlying smooth manifold, and shallow GCNNs of possibly...

### [Generalized Poincaré inequality for quantum Markov semigroups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06005v1)
**Authors:** Marius Junge, Jia Wang  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** math.OA, math.PR, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We prove a noncommutative $(p,p)$-Poincaré inequality for trace-symmetric quantum Markov semigroups on tracial von Neumann algebras, assuming only the existence of a spectral gap. Extending semi-commutative results of Huang and Tropp, our argument uses Markov dilations to obtain chain-rule estimates for Dirichlet forms and employs amalgamated free products to define an appropriate noncommutative d...

### [From Superradiance to Superabsorption: An Exact Treatment of Non-Markovian Cooperative Radiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05989v1)
**Authors:** Ignacio González, Ángel Rivas  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate the emergence of cooperative radiation phenomena in ensembles of two-level atoms coupled to a lossy resonant cavity beyond the Markovian and mean-field approximations. By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamic...

### [Breaking the Exponential: Decoherence-Driven Power-Law Spontaneous Emission in Waveguide Quantum Electrodynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05884v1)
**Authors:** Stefano Longhi  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** We investigate the spontaneous emission of a two-level system coupled to a photonic waveguide, showing that dynamical dephasing in the photon modes profoundly alters the decay law. In the absence of dephasing, the emitter displays conventional exponential decay followed by a long-time power-law tail -- observable only at extremely low survival probabilities. Strikingly, when dephasing is introduce...

### [Continuous-time noise mitigation in analogue quantum simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05952v1)
**Authors:** Gabriele Bressanini, Yue Ma, Hyukjoon Kwon et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Analogue quantum simulators offer a promising route to explore quantum many-body dynamics beyond classical reach in the near term. However, their vulnerability to noise limits the accuracy of simulations. Here, we establish a new framework for mitigating noise in analogue quantum simulation, operating in a time-continuous manner. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol that is fully analogue ...

### [Below-threshold error reduction in single photons through photon distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05947v1)
**Authors:** F. H. B. Somhorst, J. Saied, N. Kannan et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Photonic quantum computers use the bosonic statistics of photons to construct, through quantum interference, the large entangled states required for measurement-based quantum computation. Therefore, any which-way information present in the photons will degrade quantum interference and introduce errors. While quantum error correction can address such errors in principle, it is highly resource-inten...

### [Universal Dilation of Linear Itô SDEs: Quantum Trajectories and Lindblad Simulation of Second Moments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05928v1)
**Authors:** Hsuan-Cheng Wu, Xiantao Li  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a universal framework for simulating $N$-dimensional linear Itô stochastic differential equations (SDEs) on quantum computers with additive or multiplicative noises. Building on a unitary dilation technique, we establish a rigorous correspondence between the general linear SDE \[ dX_t = A(t) X_t\,dt + \sum_{j=1}^J B_j(t)X_t\,dW_t^j \] and a Stochastic Schrödinger Equation (SSE) on a dil...

### [Dynamical entanglement percolation with spatially correlated disorder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05925v1)
**Authors:** Lorenzo Cirigliano, Valentina Brosco, Claudio Castellano et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn  

**Abstract:** The distribution of entanglement between the nodes of a quantum network plays a fundamental role in quantum information applications. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of a network of qubits where each edge corresponds to an independent two-qubit interaction. By applying tools from percolation theory, we study how entanglement dynamically spreads across the network. We show that the interp...

### [AdaFuse: Adaptive Ensemble Decoding with Test-Time Scaling for LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06022v1)
**Authors:** Chengming Cui, Tianxin Wei, Ziyi Chen et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths arising from differences in pretraining data, model architectures, and decoding behaviors. Inference-time ensembling provides a practical way to combine these capabilities without retraining. However, existing ensemble approaches suffer from fundamental limitations. Most rely on fixed fusion granularity, which lacks the flexibility requi...

### [LookAroundNet: Extending Temporal Context with Transformers for Clinically Viable EEG Seizure Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06016v1)
**Authors:** Þór Sverrisson, Steinn Guðmundsson  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segm...

### [Slow mixing and emergent one-form symmetries in three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06010v1)
**Authors:** Charles Stahl, Benedikt Placke, Vedika Khemani et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Symmetry-breaking order at low temperatures is often accompanied by slow relaxation dynamics, due to diverging free-energy barriers arising from interfaces between different ordered states. Here, we extend this correspondence to classical topological order, where the ordered states are locally indistinguishable, so there is no notion of interfaces between them. We study the relaxation dynamics of ...

### [Detecting Stochasticity in Discrete Signals via Nonparametric Excursion Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06009v1)
**Authors:** Sunia Tanweer, Firas A. Khasawneh  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, eess.SP, math.PR, stat.AP  

**Abstract:** We develop a practical framework for distinguishing diffusive stochastic processes from deterministic signals using only a single discrete time series. Our approach is based on classical excursion and crossing theorems for continuous semimartingales, which correlates number $N_\varepsilon$ of excursions of magnitude at least $\varepsilon$ with the quadratic variation $[X]_T$ of the process. The sc...

### [Scaleable LED-pumped Room-temperature Maser using a Multi-blade Optical Injector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06008v1)
**Authors:** Mingyang Liu, Zike Cheng, Ziqiu Huang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** physics.optics, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Though the performance of room-temperature masers has improved over the last decade, relatively little attention has been paid to the optics used to pump the maser's gain medium. In this work, we investigate a novel multi-blade optical ``injector'' that permits more effective and more scaleable pumping. The reported work encompasses an interdisciplinary mix of conceptualization, simulation, crysta...

### [The Molecular Structure of Thought: Mapping the Topology of Long Chain-of-Thought Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06002v1)
**Authors:** Qiguang Chen, Yantao Du, Ziniu Li et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) often fail to learn effective long chain-of-thought (Long CoT) reasoning from human or non-Long-CoT LLMs imitation. To understand this, we propose that effective and learnable Long CoT trajectories feature stable molecular-like structures in unified view, which are formed by three interaction types: Deep-Reasoning (covalent-like), Self-Reflection (hydrogen-bond-like), ...

### [Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05991v1)
**Authors:** Jiayu Ding, Haoran Tang, Ge Li  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instructio...

### [CyberGFM: Graph Foundation Models for Lateral Movement Detection in Enterprise Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05988v1)
**Authors:** Isaiah J. King, Bernardo Trindade, Benjamin Bowman et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** cs.CR, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Representing networks as a graph and training a link prediction model using benign connections is an effective method of anomaly-based intrusion detection. Existing works using this technique have shown great success using temporal graph neural networks and skip-gram-based approaches on random walks. However, random walk-based approaches are unable to incorporate rich edge data, while the GNN-base...

**Abstract:** As emerging applications demand higher throughput and lower latencies, operators are increasingly deploying millimeter-wave (mmWave) links within x-haul transport networks, spanning fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul segments. However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Servic...

**Abstract:** We propose DeePM (Deep Portfolio Manager), a structured deep-learning macro portfolio manager trained end-to-end to maximize a robust, risk-adjusted utility. DeePM addresses three fundamental challenges in financial learning: (1) it resolves the asynchronous "ragged filtration" problem via a Directed Delay (Causal Sieve) mechanism that prioritizes causal impulse-response learning over information ...

**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The constrained combinatorial multi-armed bandit model has been widely employed to solve problems in wireless networking and related areas, including the problem of wireless scheduling for throughput optimization under unknown channel conditions. Most work in this area uses an algorithm design strategy that combines a bandit learning algorithm with the virtual queue technique to track the throughp...

### [Generation of squeezed optical states via stored classical pulses in a Bose gas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05908v1)
**Authors:** Sevilay Sevinçli, Dennis Rätzel, Markus Krutzik et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.quant-gas  

**Abstract:** We propose and analyze a scheme to generate squeezed light by storing a classical probe pulse in a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) and exploiting the nonlinear evolution caused by atom--atom collisions during the storage time. A $Λ$-type optical memory interface maps a chosen temporal probe mode onto a single phase-matched collective spin wave; for a coherent input this prepares a tunable coherent...

### [Sub-Planck structure quantification in non-Gaussian probability densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05898v1)
**Authors:** Darren W. Moore, Vojtěch Švarc, Kratveer Singh et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Sub-Planck structures in non-Gaussian probability densities of phase space variables are pervasive in bosonic quantum systems. They are almost universally present if the bosonic system evolves via nonlinear dynamics or nonlinear measurements. So far, identification and comparison of such structures remains qualitative. Here we provide a universally applicable and experimentally friendly method to ...

**Published:** 2026-01-09  
**Updated:** 2026-01-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The rate of $m$-photon transitions in matter, induced by an incident light field, depends on the field's $m$th order coherence function. Consequently, the coherence properties of the light field may be shaped to increase the rate of multi-photon transitions. Here, we determine the optimal state of a weak fixed-intensity, narrow-band incident light field, with a restricted maximal photon number, th...
