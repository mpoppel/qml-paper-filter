### [Optimized Measurement Schedules for the Surface Code with Dropout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10871v1)
**Authors:** Benjamin Anker, Dripto M. Debroy  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that fabrication defects can be well-handled using a strategy relying on the mid-error-correction-cycle state. In this work we present two improvements to the original prescription. First, we quantify the impact of the choice of a more complete set of gauge operators originally proposed for the hex-grid surface code on the standard square-grid surface code, as well as a new m...

### [ImplicitRDP: An End-to-End Visual-Force Diffusion Policy with Structural Slow-Fast Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10946v1)
**Authors:** Wendi Chen, Han Xue, Yi Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Human-level contact-rich manipulation relies on the distinct roles of two key modalities: vision provides spatially rich but temporally slow global context, while force sensing captures rapid, high-frequency local contact dynamics. Integrating these signals is challenging due to their fundamental frequency and informational disparities. In this work, we propose ImplicitRDP, a unified end-to-end vi...

### [Metrics on completely positive maps via noncommutative geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10842v1)
**Authors:** Are Austad, Erik Bédos, Jonas Eidesen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** math.OA, math.FA, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** By considering an infinite-dimensional analogue of the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism, we study how to induce metrics on a distinguished subset of the completely positive maps between tracial $C^*$-algebras using seminorms from noncommutative geometry. Under suitable conditions on the these seminorms, we show that the induced metrics will satisfy the quantum information theoretic properties of stab...

### [Qubit decoherence in dissipative two-photon resonator: real-time instantons and Wigner function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10921v1)
**Authors:** V. Yu. Mylnikov, S. O. Potashin, Alex Kamenev  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study the quantum dynamics of a single bosonic cavity subject to two-photon driving and two-photon dissipation in the presence of finite detuning. Exploiting a hidden time-reversal symmetry, the Wigner representation and the WKB method, we introduce an effective phase-space potential for description of the steady state. It reveals two attracting points, which are metastable due to quantum fluct...

### [ENTCALC: Toolkit for calculating geometric entanglement in multipartite quantum systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10884v1)
**Authors:** Piotr Masajada, Aby Philip, Alexander Streltsov  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present entcalc, a Python and MATLAB package for estimating the geometric entanglement of multipartite quantum states. The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper boun...

### [SceneMaker: Open-set 3D Scene Generation with Decoupled De-occlusion and Pose Estimation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10957v1)
**Authors:** Yukai Shi, Weiyu Li, Zihao Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We propose a decoupled 3D scene generation framework called SceneMaker in this work. Due to the lack of sufficient open-set de-occlusion and pose estimation priors, existing methods struggle to simultaneously produce high-quality geometry and accurate poses under severe occlusion and open-set settings. To address these issues, we first decouple the de-occlusion model from 3D object generation, and...

### [Bidirectional Normalizing Flow: From Data to Noise and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10953v1)
**Authors:** Yiyang Lu, Qiao Sun, Xianbang Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Normalizing Flows (NFs) have been established as a principled framework for generative modeling. Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact ...

**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The success of modern machine learning hinges on access to high-quality training data. In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorpor...

### [Are We Ready for RL in Text-to-3D Generation? A Progressive Investigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10949v1)
**Authors:** Yiwen Tang, Zoey Guo, Kaixin Zhu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation signific...

**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Recent advances in subject-driven video generation with large diffusion models have enabled personalized content synthesis conditioned on user-provided subjects. However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose Alch...

**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Reasoning goes beyond language; the real world requires reasoning about space, time, affordances, and much more that words alone cannot convey. Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, ...

### [OmniView: An All-Seeing Diffusion Model for 3D and 4D View Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10940v1)
**Authors:** Xiang Fan, Sharath Girish, Vivek Ramanujan et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Prior approaches injecting camera control into diffusion models have focused on specific subsets of 4D consistency tasks: novel view synthesis, text-to-video with camera control, image-to-video, amongst others. Therefore, these fragmented approaches are trained on disjoint slices of available 3D/4D data. We introduce OmniView, a unified framework that generalizes across a wide range of 4D consiste...

**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We fi...

### [On Decision-Making Agents and Higher-Order Causal Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10937v1)
**Authors:** Matt Wilson  
**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.AI, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We establish a precise correspondence between decision-making agents in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and one-input process functions, the classical limit of higher-order quantum operations. In this identification an agent's policy and memory update combine into a process function w that interacts with a POMDP environment via the link product. This suggests a dual interpr...

**Abstract:** The construction of adversarial attacks for neural networks appears to be a crucial challenge for their deployment in various services. To estimate the adversarial robustness of a neural network, a fast and efficient approach is needed to construct adversarial attacks. Since the formalization of adversarial attack construction involves solving a specific optimization problem, we consider the probl...

**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** We present Any4D, a scalable multi-view transformer for metric-scale, dense feed-forward 4D reconstruction. Any4D directly generates per-pixel motion and geometry predictions for N frames, in contrast to prior work that typically focuses on either 2-view dense scene flow or sparse 3D point tracking. Moreover, unlike other recent methods for 4D reconstruction from monocular RGB videos, Any4D can pr...

### [Asynchronous Reasoning: Training-Free Interactive Thinking LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10931v1)

**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Many state-of-the-art LLMs are trained to think before giving their answer. Reasoning can greatly improve language model capabilities and safety, but it also makes them less interactive: given a new input, a model must stop thinking before it can respond. Real-world use cases such as voice-based or embedded assistants require an LLM agent to respond and adapt to additional information in real time...

### [Noisy Quantum Learning Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10929v1)
**Authors:** Jordan Cotler, Weiyuan Gong, Ishaan Kannan  
**Published:** 2025-12-11

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC, cs.IT, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We develop a framework for learning from noisy quantum experiments, focusing on fault-tolerant devices accessing uncharacterized systems through noisy couplings. Our starting point is the complexity class $\textsf{NBQP}$ ("noisy BQP"), modeling noisy fault-tolerant quantum computers that cannot, in general, error-correct the oracle systems they query. Using this class, we show that for natural ora...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.RO, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Temporal-difference (TD) methods learn state and action values efficiently by bootstrapping from their own future value predictions, but such a self-bootstrapping mechanism is prone to bootstrapping bias, where the errors in the value targets accumulate across steps and result in biased value estimates. Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action seque...

**Published:** 2025-12-11  
**Updated:** 2025-12-11  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** The resource requirements of Neural Networks can be significantly reduced through pruning -- the removal of seemingly less important parameters. However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of...

**Abstract:** We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not ...

This enables us to compute the physically normali...

**Abstract:** Parabolic trough Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) plants operate large hydraulic networks of collector loops that must deliver a uniform outlet temperature despite spatially heterogeneous optical performance, heat losses, and pressure drops. While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbala...

**Abstract:** Discrete diffusion models achieve strong performance across language and other discrete domains, providing a powerful alternative to autoregressive models. However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current m...

**Abstract:** Quantum Imaginary-Time Evolution (QITE) is a powerful method for preparing ground states on quantum hardware. However, executing QITE has costly measurement budgets for general Hamiltonians. Both fidelity and computational cost are strongly dependent on the definition of suitable local domains and Hamiltonian partitions. In this work, we introduce the Multiple-Time QITE algorithm (MT-QITE). We sho...

**Abstract:** Many routing and flow optimization problems in wired networks can be solved efficiently using minimum cost flow formulations. However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link become...

**Abstract:** Transport-based methods have emerged as a leading paradigm for building generative models from large, clean datasets. However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distrib...
