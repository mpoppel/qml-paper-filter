### [Mathieu Control of the Effective Coupling in Superconducting Qubits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24992v1)
**Authors:** Yi-Han Yu, Xin-Yi Li, Kai Xu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A common challenge in superconducting quantum circuits is the trade-off between strong coupling and computational subspace integrity. We present Mathieu control, which uses a non-resonant two-photon drive to create a selective nonlinear frequency shift. This shift modifies interactions while preserving qubit states, enabling continuous tuning of the ZZ coupling, including full suppression, and int...

### [Strategies for Overcoming Gradient Troughs in the ADAPT-VQE Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25004v1)
**Authors:** Jonas Stadelmann, Julian Übelher, Mafalda Ramôa et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The adaptive derivative-assembled problem-tailored variational quantum eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE) provides a promising approach for simulating highly correlated quantum systems on quantum devices, as it strikes a balance between hardware efficiency, trainability, and accuracy. Although ADAPT-VQE avoids many of the shortcomings of other VQEs, it is sometimes hindered by a phenomenon known as gradient ...

### [Diffusion Language Models are Provably Optimal Parallel Samplers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25014v1)
**Authors:** Haozhe Jiang, Nika Haghtalab, Lijie Chen  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequ...

### [Lindbladian PT phase transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24981v1)
**Authors:** Yuma Nakanishi, Tomohiro Sasamoto  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A parity-time (PT) transition is a spectral transition characteristic of non-Hermitian generators; it typically occurs at an exceptional point, where multiple eigenvectors coalesce. The concept of a PT transition has been extended to Markovian open quantum systems, which are described by the GKSL equation. Interestingly, the PT transition in many-body Markovian open quantum systems, the so-called ...

### [No-cost Bell Nonlocality Certification from Quantum Tomography and Its Applications in Quantum Magic Witnessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25068v1)
**Authors:** Pawel Cieslinski, Lukas Knips, Harald Weinfurter et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Tomographic measurements are the standard tool for characterizing quantum states, yet they are usually regarded only as means for state reconstruction or fidelity measurement. Here, we show that the same Pauli-basis measurements (X, Y, Z) can be directly employed for the certification of nonlocality at no additional experimental cost. Our framework allows any tomographic data - including archival ...

### [Any Clifford+T circuit can be controlled with constant T-depth overhead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24982v1)
**Authors:** Isaac H. Kim, Tuomas Laakkonen  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Since an n-qubit circuit consisting of CNOT gates can have up to $Ω(n^2/\log{n})$ CNOT gates, it is natural to expect that $Ω(n^2/\log{n})$ Toffoli gates are needed to apply a controlled version of such a circuit. We show that the Toffoli count can be reduced to at most n. The Toffoli depth can also be reduced to O(1), at the cost of 2n Toffoli gates, even without using any ancilla or measurement....

**Authors:** Zhening Huang, Hyeonho Jeong, Xuelin Chen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animati...

### [Vulcan: Instance-Optimal Systems Heuristics Through LLM-Driven Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25065v1)
**Authors:** Rohit Dwivedula, Divyanshu Saxena, Sujay Yadalam et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.OS, cs.AI, cs.DC  

**Abstract:** Resource-management tasks in modern operating and distributed systems continue to rely primarily on hand-designed heuristics for tasks such as scheduling, caching, or active queue management. Designing performant heuristics is an expensive, time-consuming process that we are forced to continuously go through due to the constant flux of hardware, workloads and environments.   We propose a new alter...

### [Many Minds from One Model: Bayesian Transformers for Population Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25063v1)
**Authors:** Diji Yang, Yi Zhang  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into...

### [On the geometry and topology of representations: the manifolds of modular addition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25060v1)
**Authors:** Gabriela Moisescu-Pareja, Gavin McCracken, Harley Wiltzer et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The Clock and Pizza interpretations, associated with architectures differing in either uniform or learnable attention, were introduced to argue that different architectural designs can yield distinct circuits for modular addition. In this work, we show that this is not the case, and that both uniform attention and trainable attention architectures implement the same algorithm via topologically and...

### [Reliable and Resilient Collective Communication Library for LLM Training and Serving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25059v1)
**Authors:** Wei Wang, Nengneng Yu, Sixian Xiong et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.DC, cs.LG, cs.NI  

**Abstract:** Modern ML training and inference now span tens to tens of thousands of GPUs, where network faults can waste 10--15\% of GPU hours due to slow recovery. Common network errors and link fluctuations trigger timeouts that often terminate entire jobs, forcing expensive checkpoint rollback during training and request reprocessing during inference. We present R$^2$CCL, a fault-tolerant communication libr...

### [AdaGReS:Adaptive Greedy Context Selection via Redundancy-Aware Scoring for Token-Budgeted RAG](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25052v1)
**Authors:** Chao Peng, Bin Wang, Zhilei Long et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IR  

**Abstract:** Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is highly sensitive to the quality of selected context, yet standard top-k retrieval often returns redundant or near-duplicate chunks that waste token budget and degrade downstream generation. We present AdaGReS, a redundancy-aware context selection framework for token-budgeted RAG that optimizes a set-level objective combining query-chunk relevance and intra-s...

### [Generative Classifiers Avoid Shortcut Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25034v1)
**Authors:** Alexander C. Li, Ananya Kumar, Deepak Pathak  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.NE  

**Abstract:** Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, ins...

### [Modeling Language as a Sequence of Thoughts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25026v1)
**Authors:** Nasim Borazjanizadeh, James McClelland  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Transformer language models can generate strikingly natural text by modeling language as a sequence of tokens. Yet, by relying primarily on surface-level co-occurrence statistics, they fail to form globally consistent latent representations of entities and events, lack of which contributes to brittleness in relational direction (e.g., reversal curse), contextualization errors, and data inefficienc...

### [ResponseRank: Data-Efficient Reward Modeling through Preference Strength Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25023v1)
**Authors:** Timo Kaufmann, Yannick Metz, Daniel Keim et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-an...

### [Convergence of the generalization error for deep gradient flow methods for PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25017v1)
**Authors:** Chenguang Liu, Antonis Papapantoleon, Jasper Rou  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.LG, q-fin.CP, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approx...

### [Parity order as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25011v1)
**Authors:** Ashirbad Padhan, Harsh Nigam  
**Published:** 2025-12-31  
**Updated:** 2025-12-31  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.stat-mech, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in interacting bosonic systems have been extensively studied, yet most realizations rely on fine-tuned interactions or enlarged symmetries. Here we show that a qualitatively different mechanism--parity order coupled to bond dimerization--acts as a fundamental driver of bosonic topology. Using density matrix renormalization group simulations, we identify ...

**Abstract:** The continuous matrix product state (cMPS) ansatz is a promising numerical tool for studying quantum many-body systems in continuous space. Although it provides a clean framework that allows one to directly simulate continuous systems, the optimization of cMPS is known to be a very challenging task, especially in the case of multi-component systems. In this work, we have developed an improved opti...
