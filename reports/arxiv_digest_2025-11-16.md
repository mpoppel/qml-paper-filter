### [Impacts of Decoder Latency on Utility-Scale Quantum Computer Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10633v1)
**Authors:** Abdullah Khalid, Allyson Silva, Gebremedhin A. Dagnew et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The speed of a fault-tolerant quantum computer is dictated by the reaction time of its classical electronics, that is, the total time required by decoders and controllers to determine the outcome of a logical measurement and execute subsequent conditional logical operations. Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum compute...

**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** This paper will deal with isolated laser pulses, those which last for a finite time interval and whose envelope function is strictly zero outside of this interval. We numerically calculate the Fourier transform of this function and study its asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. This work is motivated by recent results on the probability distributions of quadratic operators in second quantized ...

### [Quantum Computational Structure of $SU(N)$ Scattering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10550v1)
**Authors:** Navin McGinnis  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study scattering of particles which obey an $SU(N)$ global symmetry through the lens of quantum computation and quantum algorithms. We show that for scattering between particles which transform in the fundamental or anti-fundamental representations, i.e. qudits, all 2-2 scattering amplitudes can be constructed from only three quantum gates. Further, for any $N$, all 2-2 scattering channels are ...

### [Ordinary lattice defects as probes of topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10646v1)
**Authors:** Aiden J. Mains, Jia-Xin Zhong, Yun Jing et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.dis-nn, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In addition to topological lattice defects such as dislocations and disclinations, crystals are also accompanied by unavoidable ordinary defects, devoid of any non-trivial geometry or topology, among which vacancies, Schottky defects, substitutions, interstitials, and Frenkel pairs are the most common. In this work, we demonstrate that these ubiquitous ordinary lattice defects, though topologicall...

### [Black-Box On-Policy Distillation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10643v1)
**Authors:** Tianzhu Ye, Li Dong, Zewen Chi et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Black-box distillation creates student large language models (LLMs) by learning from a proprietary teacher model's text outputs alone, without access to its internal logits or parameters. In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its re...

### [Supernematic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10642v1)
**Authors:** Dan Mao, Eun-Ah Kim  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, math.CO, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum theory of geometrically frustrated systems is usually approached as a gauge theory where the local conservation law becomes the Gauss law. Here we show that it can do something fundamentally different: enforce a global conserved quantity via a non-perturbative tiling invariant, rigorously linking microscopic geometry to a new macroscopically phase-coherent state. In a frustrated bosonic mo...

### [Emergent spin order and steady-state superradiance in one-dimensional baths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10638v1)
**Authors:** Silvia Cardenas-Lopez, Edgar Guardiola-Navarrete, Ana Asenjo-Garcia  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Spontaneous collective decay in driven atomic ensembles can generate coherence far from equilibrium, as illustrated by superradiant lasers where decay into a single-mode cavity synchronizes atomic phases into a macroscopic dipole and yields superradiant emission of light with an ultranarrow spectrum. Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collectiv...

### [Robot Crash Course: Learning Soft and Stylized Falling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10635v1)
**Authors:** Pascal Strauch, David Müller, Sammy Christen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Despite recent advances in robust locomotion, bipedal robots operating in the real world remain at risk of falling. While most research focuses on preventing such events, we instead concentrate on the phenomenon of falling itself. Specifically, we aim to reduce physical damage to the robot while providing users with control over a robot's end pose. To this end, we propose a robot agnostic reward f...

### [Global Solutions to Non-Convex Functional Constrained Problems with Hidden Convexity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10626v1)
**Authors:** Ilyas Fatkhullin, Niao He, Guanghui Lan et al.  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Constrained non-convex optimization is fundamentally challenging, as global solutions are generally intractable and constraint qualifications may not hold. However, in many applications, including safe policy optimization in control and reinforcement learning, such problems possess hidden convexity, meaning they can be reformulated as convex programs via a nonlinear invertible transformation. Typi...

**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities, yet existing test-time frameworks often rely on coarse self-verification and self-correction, limiting their effectiveness on complex tasks. In this paper, we propose Socratic Self-Refine (SSR), a novel framework for fine-grained evaluation and precise refinement of LLM reasoning. Our proposed SSR decomposes model respo...

**Authors:** Benjamin L. Badger, Matthew Neligeorge  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.IT, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Language prediction is constrained by informational entropy intrinsic to language, such that there exists a limit to how accurate any language model can become and equivalently a lower bound to language compression. The most efficient language compression algorithms today are causal (next token prediction) large language models, but the use of these models to form accurate estimates of language en...

### [Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10595v1)
**Authors:** Alan Sherry, Saptarshi Mandal, Sthitadhi Roy  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.dis-nn, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the me...

**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We propose a new General Game Playing (GGP) system called Regular Games (RG). The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, ...

**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Equitably allocating limited resources in high-stakes domains-such as education, employment, and healthcare-requires balancing short-term utility with long-term impact, while accounting for delayed outcomes, hidden heterogeneity, and ethical constraints. However, most learning-based allocation frameworks either assume immediate feedback or ignore the complex interplay between individual characteri...

### [Crossing Symmetry and Entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10559v1)
**Authors:** Navin McGinnis  
**Published:** 2025-11-13  
**Updated:** 2025-11-13  
**Categories:** hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We study the interplay between crossing symmetry and entanglement in $2 \to 2$ scattering within local quantum field theories that possess an $SU(N)$ global symmetry. In particular, we recast scattering amplitudes of fixed helicity as quantum operations on the Hilbert space of internal quantum numbers, where the external states play the role of qudits. The entire space of $SU(N)$-invariant scatter...
