### [Differentiable Logical Programming for Quantum Circuit Discovery and Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08880v1)
**Authors:** Antonin Sulc  
**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Designing high-fidelity quantum circuits remains challenging, and current paradigms often depend on heuristic, fixed-ansatz structures or rule-based compilers that can be suboptimal or lack generality. We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework that reframes quantum circuit design as a differentiable logic programming problem. Our model represents a scaffold of potential quantum gates and parameteriz...

### [High-Probability Heralded Entanglement via Repeated Spin-Photon Phase Encoding with Moderate Cooperativity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08834v1)
**Authors:** Yu Liu, Martin B. Plenio  
**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We propose a heralded high-probability scheme to generate remote entanglement between moderate-cooperativity spin-cavity registers with high fidelity. In conventional single-shot interfaces, limited cooperativity restricts the spin-conditional optical response and thus strongly suppresses the success probability. Our proposal instead recycles a single incident photon for repeated interactions with...

**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum synchronisation errors are a class of quantum errors that change the number of qubits in a quantum system. The classical error correction of synchronisation errors has been well-studied, including an insertion-deletion equivalence more than a half-century ago, but little progress has been made towards the quantum counterpart since the birth of quantum error correction. We address the longs...

**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Out of distribution (OOD) robustness in autonomous driving is often reduced to a single number, hiding what breaks a policy. We decompose environments along five axes: scene (rural/urban), season, weather, time (day/night), and agent mix; and measure performance under controlled $k$-factor perturbations ($k \in \{0,1,2,3\}$). Using closed loop control in VISTA, we benchmark FC, CNN, and ViT polici...

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have demonstrated exceptional performance in large-scale language models. Existing routers typically rely on non-differentiable Top-$k$+Softmax, limiting their performance and scalability. We argue that two distinct decisions, which experts to activate and how to distribute expert contributions among them, are conflated in standard Top-$k$+Softmax. We introduce Diri...

**Abstract:** We study homology of ample groupoids via the compactly supported Moore complex of the nerve. Let $A$ be a topological abelian group. For $n\ge 0$ set $C_n(\mathcal G;A) := C_c(\mathcal G_n,A)$ and define $\partial_n^A=\sum_{i=0}^n(-1)^i(d_i)_*$. This defines $H_n(\mathcal G;A)$. The theory is functorial for continuous étale homomorphisms. It is compatible with standard reductions, including restri...

**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** In hierarchical multi-label classification, a persistent challenge is enabling model predictions to reach deeper levels of the hierarchy for more detailed or fine-grained classifications. This difficulty partly arises from the natural rarity of certain classes (or hierarchical nodes) and the hierarchical constraint that ensures child nodes are almost always less frequent than their parents. To add...

**Abstract:** Traditional cognitive assessments often rely on isolated, output-focused measurements that may fail to capture the complexity of human cognition in naturalistic settings. We present pixelLOG, a high-performance data collection framework for Spigot-based Minecraft servers designed specifically for process-based cognitive research. Unlike existing frameworks tailored only for artificial intelligence...

### [CausalT5K: Diagnosing and Informing Refusal for Trustworthy Causal Reasoning of Skepticism, Sycophancy, Detection-Correction, and Rung Collapse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08939v1)
**Authors:** Longling Geng, Andy Ouyang, Theodore Wu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** LLM failures in causal reasoning, including sycophancy, rung collapse, and miscalibrated refusal, are well-documented, yet progress on remediation is slow because no benchmark enables systematic diagnosis. We introduce CausalT5K, a diagnostic benchmark of over 5,000 cases across 10 domains that tests three critical capabilities: (1) detecting rung collapse, where models answer interventional queri...

### [Provably robust learning of regression neural networks using $β$-divergences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08933v1)
**Authors:** Abhik Ghosh, Suryasis Jana

**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG, cs.NE, stat.ME  

**Abstract:** Regression neural networks (NNs) are most commonly trained by minimizing the mean squared prediction error, which is highly sensitive to outliers and data contamination. Existing robust training methods for regression NNs are often limited in scope and rely primarily on empirical validation, with only a few offering partial theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a new robust learning fr...

### [DynamiQ: Accelerating Gradient Synchronization using Compressed Multi-hop All-reduce](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08923v1)
**Authors:** Wenchen Han, Shay Vargaftik, Michael Mitzenmacher et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DC, cs.NI  

**Abstract:** Multi-hop all-reduce is the de facto backbone of large model training. As the training scale increases, the network often becomes a bottleneck, motivating reducing the volume of transmitted data. Accordingly, recent systems demonstrated significant acceleration of the training process using gradient quantization. However, these systems are not optimized for multi-hop aggregation, where entries are...

### [GEMSS: A Variational Bayesian Method for Discovering Multiple Sparse Solutions in Classification and Regression Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08913v1)
**Authors:** Kateřina Henclová, Václav Šmídl  
**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Selecting interpretable feature sets in underdetermined ($n \ll p$) and highly correlated regimes constitutes a fundamental challenge in data science, particularly when analyzing physical measurements. In such settings, multiple distinct sparse subsets may explain the response equally well. Identifying these alternatives is crucial for generating domain-specific insights into the underlying mechan...

### [Quantum Riemannian Cubics with Obstacle Avoidance for Quantum Geometric Model Predictive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08881v1)
**Authors:** Leonardo Colombo  
**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** math-ph, eess.SY, math.OC, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We propose a geometric model predictive control framework for quantum systems subject to smoothness and state constraints. By formulating quantum state evolution intrinsically on the projective Hilbert space, we penalize covariant accelerations to generate smooth trajectories in the form of Riemannian cubics, while incorporating state-dependent constraints through potential functions. A structure-...

### [High-brightness fiber-based Sagnac source of entangled photon pairs for multiplexed quantum networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08863v1)
**Authors:** Tess Troisi, Yoann Pelet, Romain Dalidet et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-09  
**Updated:** 2026-02-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** A fully fibered source of entangled photon pairs based on a nonlinear Sagnac interferometer is reported. Operating at telecom wavelengths, the source relies exclusively on standard fiber-optic components and periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN) waveguides, resulting in a compact, robust, and field-deployable architecture. The generation stage supports both polarization and energy-time entangl...

**Abstract:** A photoluminescence (PL) and magnetic resonance investigation of a defect in chlorine-implanted 4H-SiC is presented. This Cl-related center emits light at telecom wavelengths with zero-phonon lines in the range 1350-1540 nm. Its four configurations exhibit stable PL spectra characterized by narrow zero-phonon lines. For the two configurations that emit light at the C-band, a Debye-Waller factor in...
