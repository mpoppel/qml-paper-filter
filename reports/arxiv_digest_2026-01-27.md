### [Universality of Many-body Projected Ensemble for Learning Quantum Data Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18637v1)
**Authors:** Quoc Hoan Tran, Koki Chinzei, Yasuhiro Endo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Generating quantum data by learning the underlying quantum distribution poses challenges in both theoretical and practical scenarios, yet it is a critical task for understanding quantum systems. A fundamental question in quantum machine learning (QML) is the universality of approximation: whether a parameterized QML model can approximate any quantum distribution. We address this question by provin...

### [Practical block encodings of matrix polynomials that can also be trivially controlled](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18767v1)
**Authors:** Martina Nibbi, Filippo Della Chiara, Yizhi Shen et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum circuits naturally implement unitary operations on input quantum states. However, non-unitary operations can also be implemented through block encodings, where additional ancilla qubits are introduced and later measured. While block encoding has a number of well-established theoretical applications, its practical implementation has been prohibitively expensive for current quantum hardware....

**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** physics.optics, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Genuine quantum interference between independent nonlinear processes of different order provides a route to coherent control that cannot be reduced to a classical field interference. Here we present an all-optical analogue of coherent carrier injection by exploiting interference between second- and third-order quantum nonlinear processes in an integrated photonic platform. Photon pairs generated v...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In this work, we study the Hamiltonian Decoded Quantum Interferometry (HDQI) for the general Hamiltonians $H=\sum_ic_iP_i$ on an $n$-qubit system, where the coefficients $c_i\in \mathbb{R}$ and $P_i$ are Pauli operators. We show that, given access to an appropriate decoding oracle, there exist efficient quantum algorithms for preparing the state $ρ_{\mathcal P}(H) = \frac{\mathcal P^2(H)}{\text{Tr...

### [Reuse your FLOPs: Scaling RL on Hard Problems by Conditioning on Very Off-Policy Prefixes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18795v1)
**Authors:** Amrith Setlur, Zijian Wang, Andrew Cohen et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods for LLM reasoning waste compute on hard problems, where correct on-policy traces are rare, policy gradients vanish, and learning stalls. To bootstrap more efficient RL, we consider reusing old sampling FLOPs (from prior inference or RL training) in the form of off-policy traces. Standard off-policy methods supervise against off-policy data, causing insta...

**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Unsupervised text segmentation is crucial because boundary labels are expensive, subjective, and often fail to transfer across domains and granularity choices. We propose Embed-KCPD, a training-free method that represents sentences as embedding vectors and estimates boundaries by minimizing a penalized KCPD objective. Beyond the algorithmic instantiation, we develop, to our knowledge, the first de...

### [POPE: Learning to Reason on Hard Problems via Privileged On-Policy Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18779v1)
**Authors:** Yuxiao Qu, Amrith Setlur, Virginia Smith et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has improved the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), yet state-of-the-art methods still fail to learn on many training problems. On hard problems, on-policy RL rarely explores even a single correct rollout, yielding zero reward and no learning signal for driving improvement. We find that natural solutions to remedy this exploration problem from classica...

**Authors:** Hongru Cai, Yongqi Li, Tiezheng Yu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to align outputs with human preferences, and personalized alignment further adapts models to individual users. This relies on personalized reward models that capture user-specific preferences and automatically provide individualized feedback. However, developing these models faces two critical challenges: the scarcity of feedback from individual users...

### [Reflect: Transparent Principle-Guided Reasoning for Constitutional Alignment at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18730v1)
**Authors:** Henry Bell, Caroline Zhang, Mohammed Mobasserul Haque et al.  
**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The constitutional framework of alignment aims to align large language models (LLMs) with value-laden principles written in natural language (such as to avoid using biased language). Prior work has focused on parameter fine-tuning techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), to instill these principles. However, these approaches are computationally demanding, require care...

### [On the Stochastic-Quantum Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18720v1)
**Authors:** Sami Calvo  
**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** This paper aims to first explain, somewhat more clearly, the Stochastic-Quantum correspondence put forward in by Barandes in 2023. Specifically, the quantum-mechanical bra-ket notation is used, illuminating some results of previous results. With this, we prove the six axioms of textbook quantum mechanics from a single axiom: every physical system evolves according to a, generally indivisible, stoc...

**Categories:** cs.AI, q-bio.BM  

**Abstract:** Alzheimer's disease (AD) is marked by the pathological accumulation of amyloid beta-42 (Abeta-42), contributing to synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. While extracellular amyloid plaques are well-studied, increasing evidence highlights intracellular Abeta-42 as an early and toxic driver of disease progression. In this study, we present a novel, AI-assisted drug design approach to promote t...

**Abstract:** Machine learning-based surrogate models have emerged as more efficient alternatives to numerical solvers for physical simulations over complex geometries, such as car bodies. Many existing models incorporate the simulation mesh as an additional input, thereby reducing prediction errors. However, generating a simulation mesh for new geometries is computationally costly. In contrast, mesh-free metho...

**Published:** 2026-01-26  
**Updated:** 2026-01-26  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** This paper introduces quasi-Monte Carlo latent variable models (QLVMs): a class of deep generative models that are specialized for finding extremely low-dimensional and interpretable embeddings of high-dimensional datasets. Unlike standard approaches, which rely on a learned encoder and variational lower bounds, QLVMs directly approximate the marginal likelihood by randomized quasi-Monte Carlo int...

**Abstract:** Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently demonstrated promising potential in scientific machine learning, partly due to their capacity for grid adaptation during training. However, existing adaptation strategies rely solely on input data density, failing to account for the geometric complexity of the target function or metrics calculated during network training. In this work, we propose a g...
