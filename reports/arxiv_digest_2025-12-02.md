### [Low-Rank Prehab: Preparing Neural Networks for SVD Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01980v1)
**Authors:** Haoran Qin, Shansita Sharma, Ali Abbasi et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-01  
**Updated:** 2025-12-01  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Low-rank approximation methods such as singular value decomposition (SVD) and its variants (e.g., Fisher-weighted SVD, Activation SVD) have recently emerged as effective tools for neural network compression. In this setting, decomposition acts as a "surgical" intervention, followed by fine-tuning that serves as "rehab" to recover accuracy. Inspired by prehabilitation in surgery, we introduce a pre...

### [On-chip high-order parametric downconversion in the excitonic Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ for programmable multiphoton entangled states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01874v1)
**Authors:** Dmitry Skachkov, Dirk R. Englund, Michael N. Leuenberger  
**Published:** 2025-12-01  
**Updated:** 2025-12-01  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing in $χ^{(2)}$ and $χ^{(3)}$ media underpin most entangled-photon sources, but direct generation of higher-order entangled multiphoton states by $n$-th order parametric downconversion remains extremely challenging because conventional materials exhibit tiny high-order nonlinearities. Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an exc...

**Abstract:** We extend the framework of quantum pushforward designs to the approximate setting, where averaging is achieved only up to finite precision. Using Schatten $p$-norms and Lipschitz continuity arguments, we derive bounds on the approximation parameters of pushforward designs obtained from complex projective spaces, including simplices, mixed states, and quantum channels. In the mixed-state case, we r...

### [A Fluctuation-Dissipation Structure of Quantum Dynamical Semigroups Reveals a Unique Internal Hamiltonian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01840v1)

**Abstract:** We refine a fluctuation-dissipation framework for quantum dynamical semigroups to resolve a long-standing ambiguity in Markovian master equations. For finite-dimensional systems, we prove that the underlying diffusion-dissipation structure - rooted in a classical Markov process analogy - is invariant under Lindblad generator symmetries. This invariance uniquely identifies the internal Hamiltonian....

**Abstract:** We consider coherently-coupled bosonic mixtures scattering at low energies in the presence of an external confinement along either one or two directions. We exactly solve the two-body scattering problem, showing that for large Rabi coupling the confinement-induced resonance can be displaced towards scattering lengths values much smaller than the oscillator length. Our results make the observation ...

### [Achievable Identification Rates in Noisy Bosonic Broadcast Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01833v1)

**Abstract:** Identification in quantum communication enables receivers to verify the presence of a message without decoding its entire content. While identification capacity has been explored for classical and finite-dimensional quantum channels, its behaviour in bosonic systems remains less understood. This work analyses identification over noisy bosonic broadcast channels using coherent states. We derive ach...
