### [Sample Complexity Bounds for Robust Mean Estimation with Mean-Shift Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22130v1)
**Authors:** Ilias Diakonikolas, Giannis Iakovidis, Daniel M. Kane et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.DS  

**Abstract:** We study the basic task of mean estimation in the presence of mean-shift contamination. In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace dist...

### [Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22205v1)
**Authors:** Aritra Ghosh, M. Bhattacharya  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph, physics.optics  

**Abstract:** Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave...

### [Computing with many encoded logical qubits beyond break-even](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22211v1)
**Authors:** Shival Dasu, Matthew DeCross, Andrew Y. Guo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** High-rate quantum error correcting (QEC) codes encode many logical qubits in a given number of physical qubits, making them promising candidates for quantum computation. Implementing high-rate codes at a scale that both frustrates classical computing and improves performance by encoding requires both high fidelity gates and long-range qubit connectivity -- both of which are offered by trapped-ion ...

### [Controlled jump in the Clifford hierarchy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22201v1)
**Authors:** Yichen Xu, Xiao Wang  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph, math-ph  

**Abstract:** We develop a simple and systematic route to higher levels of the qubit Clifford hierarchy by coherently controlling Clifford operations. Our approach is based on Pauli periodicity, defined for a Clifford unitary $U$ as the smallest integer $m\ge 1$ such that $U^{2^{m}}$ is a Pauli operator up to phase. We prove a sharp controlled-jump rule showing that the controlled gate $CU$ lies strictly in lev...

### [Beyond Single-Shot Fidelity: Chernoff-Based Throughput Optimization in Superconducting Qubit Readout](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22174v1)
**Authors:** Sinan Bugu  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Single-shot fidelity is the standard benchmark for superconducting qubit readout, but it does not directly minimize the total wall-clock time required to certify a quantum state. We formulate an information-theoretic description of dispersive readout that treats the measurement record as a stochastic communication channel and compute the classical Chernoff information governing the multi-shot erro...

### [Exponential speedup in measurement property learning with post-measurement states](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22126v1)
**Authors:** Zhenhuan Liu, Qi Ye, Zhenyu Cai et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Learning properties of quantum states and channels is known to benefit from resources such as entangled operations, auxiliary qubits, and adaptivity, whereas the resource structure of measurement learning, namely, learning properties of quantum measurement operators, remains poorly understood. In this work, we identify a measurement learning task for which access limited to classical measurement o...

### [Trade-offs in Gauss's law error correction for lattice gauge theory quantum simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22121v1)
**Authors:** Balint Pato, Natalie Klco  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-lat, nucl-th  

**Abstract:** Gauss's law-based quantum error correction (GLQEC) offers a promising approach to reducing qubit overhead in lattice gauge theory simulations by leveraging built-in symmetries. For applications of GLQEC to 1+1D lattice quantum electrodynamics (QED), we identify two significant trade-offs. First, we prove via dimension-counting arguments that GLQEC requires periodic electric fields, thereby constra...

### [Loss Mechanisms in High-coherence Multimode Mechanical Resonators Coupled to Superconducting Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22117v1)
**Authors:** Raquel Garcia Belles, Alexander Anferov, Lukas F. Deeg et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall, cond-mat.mtrl-sci  

**Abstract:** Circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) devices have a wide range of applications in quantum science, all of which depend crucially on the quantum coherence of the mechanical subsystem. In this context, high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators (HBARs) are particularly promising, since they have shown very high quality factors with negligible dephasing. However, the introduction of piezoelectric ...

**Authors:** Hanna Yukhymenko, Anton Alexandrov, Martin Vechev  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The reliability of multilingual Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation is currently compromised by the inconsistent quality of translated benchmarks. Existing resources often suffer from semantic drift and context loss, which can lead to misleading performance metrics. In this work, we present a fully automated framework designed to address these challenges by enabling scalable, high-quality transl...

### [Off-The-Shelf Image-to-Image Models Are All You Need To Defeat Image Protection Schemes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22197v1)
**Authors:** Xavier Pleimling, Sifat Muhammad Abdullah, Gunjan Balde et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Advances in Generative AI (GenAI) have led to the development of various protection strategies to prevent the unauthorized use of images. These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this i...

### [Hybrid Consensus with Quantum Sybil Resistance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22195v1)
**Authors:** Dar Gilboa, Siddhartha Jain, Or Sattath  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.DC  

**Abstract:** Sybil resistance is a key requirement of decentralized consensus protocols. It is achieved by introducing a scarce resource (such as computational power, monetary stake, disk space, etc.), which prevents participants from costlessly creating multiple fake identities and hijacking the protocol. Quantum states are generically uncloneable, which suggests that they may serve naturally as an unconditio...

### [GUI-Libra: Training Native GUI Agents to Reason and Act with Action-aware Supervision and Partially Verifiable RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22190v1)
**Authors:** Rui Yang, Qianhui Wu, Zhaoyang Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Open-source native GUI agents still lag behind closed-source systems on long-horizon navigation tasks. This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning ...

### [Surrogate models for Rock-Fluid Interaction: A Grid-Size-Invariant Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22188v1)
**Authors:** Nathalie C. Pinheiro, Donghu Guo, Hannah P. Menke et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, physics.flu-dyn  

**Abstract:** Modelling rock-fluid interaction requires solving a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) to predict the flow behaviour and the reactions of the fluid with the rock on the interfaces. Conventional high-fidelity numerical models require a high resolution to obtain reliable results, resulting in huge computational expense. This restricts the applicability of these models for multi-query probl...

### [Learning and Naming Subgroups with Exceptional Survival Characteristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22179v1)
**Authors:** Mhd Jawad Al Rahwanji, Sascha Xu, Nils Philipp Walter et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** In many applications, it is important to identify subpopulations that survive longer or shorter than the rest of the population. In medicine, for example, it allows determining which patients benefit from treatment, and in predictive maintenance, which components are more likely to fail. Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assump...

### [Energy efficient optical tracking for space quantum communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22160v1)
**Authors:** Eric Vokes, Vinod N. Rao, Elinore Spencer et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Power consumption is a critical constraint for CubeSat based quantum communication, where tracking systems often dominate the onboard power budget. We demonstrate an energy-efficient approach that enables reliable satellite tracking at substantially reduced beacon power by treating tracking as a weak-signal estimation task. Using a closed-loop system with fine steering mirrors and higher-order Kal...

### [Dynamic Personality Adaptation in Large Language Models via State Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22157v1)
**Authors:** Leon Pielage, Ole Hätscher, Mitja Back et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.HC, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The inability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to modulate their personality expression in response to evolving dialogue dynamics hinders their performance in complex, interactive contexts. We propose a model-agnostic framework for dynamic personality simulation that employs state machines to represent latent personality states, where transition probabilities are dynamically adapted to the conversa...

### [Time in gravitational subregions and in closed universes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22153v1)
**Authors:** Andreas Blommaert, Chang-Han Chen  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** hep-th, gr-qc, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** What are gauge-invariant local observables in a subregion in quantum gravity? How does one even define such a subregion non-perturbatively? We study these questions in JT gravity. One can define a subregion by specifying the value of the dilaton at the boundary of the region. We study conformal matter correlators in such a subregion. There is a gravitational constraint associated with York time ev...

### [Provable Last-Iterate Convergence for Multi-Objective Safe LLM Alignment via Optimistic Primal-Dual](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22146v1)
**Authors:** Yining Li, Peizhong Ju, Ness Shroff  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a significant role in aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences. While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standa...

### [When AI Writes, Whose Voice Remains? Quantifying Cultural Marker Erasure Across World English Varieties in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22145v1)
**Authors:** Satyam Kumar Navneet, Joydeep Chandra, Yong Zhang  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.HC, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to ``professionalize'' workplace communication, often at the cost of linguistic identity. We introduce "Cultural Ghosting", the systematic erasure of linguistic markers unique to non-native English varieties during text processing. Through analysis of 22,350 LLM outputs generated from 1,490 culturally marked texts (Indian, Singaporean,& Nigerian E...

**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Object hallucination is a critical issue in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), where outputs include objects that do not appear in the input image. A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work,...

**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AR  

**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) are essential for performing advanced tasks on edge or mobile devices, yet their deployment is often hindered by severe resource constraints, including limited memory, energy, and computational power. While uniform quantization provides a straightforward approach to compress model and reduce hardware requirement, it fails to fully leverage the varying robustness across ...

**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** cs.SE, cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Small language models (SLMs) offer compelling advantages in cost, latency, and adaptability, but have so far lagged behind larger models on long-horizon software engineering tasks such as SWE-bench, where they suffer from pervasive action looping and low resolution rates. We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. I...

**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Representing the time-evolution operator as a tensor network constitutes a key ingredient in several algorithms for studying quantum lattice systems at finite temperature or in a non-equilibrium setting. For a Hamiltonian composed of strictly short-ranged interactions, the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is the main technique for obtaining such a representation. In [B.~Vanhecke, L.~Vanderstraeten and...

**Authors:** Jason Doukas  
**Published:** 2026-02-25  
**Updated:** 2026-02-25  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The stochastic--quantum correspondence reinterprets quantum dynamics as arising from an underlying stochastic process on a configuration space. We generalize the correspondence by lifting an arbitrary stochastic kernel $Γ$ in finite dimension to a map $φ$ on $B(\mathcal H)$, formulating the associated lift-compatibility relation, and giving an explicit dictionary between $Γ$ and CPTP (Kraus) maps....
