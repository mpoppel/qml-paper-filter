### [Iterative Training of Physics-Informed Neural Networks with Fourier-enhanced Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19399v1)
**Authors:** Yulun Wu, Miguel Aguiar, Karl H. Johansson et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to learn low-frequency features first, is a well-known issue with many training algorithms for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). To overcome this issue, we propose IFeF-PINN, an algorithm for iterative training of PINNs with Fourier-enhanced features. The key idea is to enrich the latent space using high-frequency components through Random Fou...

### [Polarization based direction of arrival estimation using a radio interferometric array](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15116v1)
**Authors:** Sarod Yatawatta  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** astro-ph.IM, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Direction of arrival (DOA) estimation is mostly performed using specialized arrays that have carefully designed receiver spacing and layouts to match the operating frequency range. In contrast, radio interferometric arrays are designed to optimally sample the Fourier space data for making high quality images of the sky.   Therefore, using existing radio interferometric arrays (with arbitrary geome...

**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The maximum work that can be extracted from a quantum battery is bounded by the ergotropy of the system, which is determined by the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian. In this paper, we employ the formalism of quantum walks to investigate how the topology of the battery and the chirality of the Hamiltonian influence its performance as an energy storage unit. We analyze architectures of battery...

### [Entanglement production in the decay of a metastable state](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19715v1)
**Authors:** Sergei Khlebnikov  
**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph, hep-th  

**Abstract:** When a metastable state decays into radiation, there must be entanglement between the radiation and the decaying system, as well as between radiation collected at late and early times. We study the interplay between these two types of entanglement in simple Gaussian models. We define, via a windowed Fourier transform, multimode quantum states associated with radiation fragments produced at differe...

**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** A variety of infinitely wide neural architectures (e.g., dense NNs, CNNs, and transformers) induce Gaussian process (GP) priors over their outputs. These relationships provide both an accurate characterization of the prior predictive distribution and enable the use of GP machinery to improve the uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks. In this work, we extend this connection to neural o...

**Abstract:** Suppose Alice trains an open-weight language model and Bob uses a blackbox derivative of Alice's model to produce text. Can Alice prove that Bob is using her model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from the text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an independence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model or text is indepe...

### [Environment Inference for Learning Generalizable Dynamical System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19784v1)
**Authors:** Shixuan Liu, Yue He, Haotian Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Data-driven methods offer efficient and robust solutions for analyzing complex dynamical systems but rely on the assumption of I.I.D. data, driving the development of generalization techniques for handling environmental differences. These techniques, however, are limited by their dependence on environment labels, which are often unavailable during training due to data acquisition challenges, priva...

### [GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19778v1)
**Authors:** Anand Choudhary, Yasser Sulaıman, Lukas Mauch et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-22  
**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Sparse fine-tuning techniques adapt LLMs to downstream tasks by only tuning a sparse subset of model parameters. However, the effectiveness of sparse adaptation depends on optimally selecting the model parameters to be fine-tuned. In this work, we introduce a novel sparse fine-tuning technique named GaLLoP: Gradient-based Sparse Learning on Low-Magnitude Parameters, which fine-tunes only those mod...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** Membership inference attacks (MIAs) have emerged as the standard tool for evaluating the privacy risks of AI models. However, state-of-the-art attacks require training numerous, often computationally expensive, reference models, limiting their practicality. We present a novel approach for estimating model-level vulnerability, the TPR at low FPR, to membership inference attacks without requiring re...

**Abstract:** Abrikosov vortices, where the superconducting gap is completely suppressed in the core, are dissipative, semi-classical entities that impact applications from high-current-density wires to superconducting quantum devices. In contrast, we present evidence that vortices trapped in granular superconducting films can behave as two-level systems, exhibiting microsecond-range quantum coherence and energ...

**Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce an encoding of information in the relative displacement or photon number of different optical modes. Since the loss rate to interference is insensitive to squeezing and many non-Gaussian fluctuations, such a space is relatively protected from imperfections. We show that photon subtraction protocols can be used to create high-quality quantum superpositions of squeezed states with much ...

**Abstract:** Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally prohibitive for real-time,...
