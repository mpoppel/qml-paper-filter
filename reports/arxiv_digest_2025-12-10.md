### [Autonomous multi-ion optical clock with on-chip integrated photonic light delivery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08921v1)
**Authors:** Tharon D. Morrison, Joonhyuk Kwon, Matthew A. Delaney et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Integrated photonics in trapped-ion systems are critical for the realization of applications such as portable optical atomic clocks and scalable quantum computers. However, system-level integration of all required functionalities remains a key challenge. In this work, we demonstrate an autonomously operating optical clock having a short-term frequency instability of $3.14(5)\times 10^{-14} / \sqrt...

**Authors:** Adrian Parra-Rodriguez, Miguel Clavero-Rubio, Philippe Gigon et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.mes-hall  

**Abstract:** We introduce a driven-dissipative Floquet model in which a single harmonic oscillator with modulated frequency and decay realizes a non-Hermitian synthetic lattice with an effective electric field gradient in frequency space. Using the Floquet-Green's function and its doubled-space representation, we identify a topological regime that supports directional amplification and frequency conversion, ac...

### [SAQ: Stabilizer-Aware Quantum Error Correction Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08914v1)
**Authors:** David Zenati, Eliya Nachmani  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Quantum Error Correction (QEC) decoding faces a fundamental accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost. Recent neural decoders reduce complexity but lack the accuracy...

### [Emergent Non-Markovianity in Logical Qubit Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08893v1)
**Authors:** Jalan A. Ziyad, Robin Blume-Kohout, Kenneth Rudinger  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Logical qubits encoded in quantum error correcting codes can exhibit non-Markovian dynamical evolution, even when the underlying physical noise is Markovian. To understand this emergent non-Markovianity, we define a Markovianity condition appropriate to logical gate operations, and study it by relating logical operations to their physical implementation (operations on the data qubits into which th...

### [Deterministic randomness extraction for semi-device-independent quantum random number generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08900v1)
**Authors:** Pablo Tikas Pueyo, Tomás Fernández Martos, Gabriel Senno  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** It is a well-known fact in classical information theory that no deterministic procedure can extract close-to-ideal randomness from an arbitrary entropy source. On the other hand, if additional knowledge about the source is available -- e.g., that it is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials -- then deterministic extractors do exist. For quantum entropy sources, where in addition to classical r...

### [Revisiting the Scaling Properties of Downstream Metrics in Large Language Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08894v1)
**Authors:** Jakub Krajewski, Amitis Shidani, Dan Busbridge et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** While scaling laws for Large Language Models (LLMs) traditionally focus on proxy metrics like pretraining loss, predicting downstream task performance has been considered unreliable. This paper challenges that view by proposing a direct framework to model the scaling of benchmark performance from the training budget. We find that for a fixed token-to-parameter ratio, a simple power law can accurat...

**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-quality tabular synthetic data. In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementat...

### [Refining Diffusion Models for Motion Synthesis with an Acceleration Loss to Generate Realistic IMU Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08859v1)
**Authors:** Lars Ole Häusler, Lena Uhlenberg, Göran Köber et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We propose a text-to-IMU (inertial measurement unit) motion-synthesis framework to obtain realistic IMU data by fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model with an acceleration-based second-order loss (L_acc). L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate ...

**Authors:** Lex Weaver, Jonathan Baxter  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** TD($λ$) with function approximation has proved empirically successful for some complex reinforcement learning problems. For linear approximation, TD($λ$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value. However, as far as policy is concerned, it is error in the relative ordering of states that is critical, rather than error in the state v...

### [Generation is Required for Data-Efficient Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08854v1)
**Authors:** Jack Brady, Bernhard Schölkopf, Thomas Kipf et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-09  
**Updated:** 2025-12-09  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** It has been hypothesized that human-level visual perception requires a generative approach in which internal representations result from inverting a decoder. Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve h...
