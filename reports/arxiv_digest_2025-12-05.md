### [QKAN-LSTM: Quantum-inspired Kolmogorov-Arnold Long Short-term Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05049v1)
**Authors:** Yu-Chao Hsu, Jiun-Cheng Jiang, Chun-Hua Lin et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-04  
**Updated:** 2025-12-04  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are a particular type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that are central to sequential modeling tasks in domains such as urban telecommunication forecasting, where temporal correlations and nonlinear dependencies dominate. However, conventional LSTMs suffer from high parameter redundancy and limited nonlinear expressivity. In this work, we propose the Quantum...

### [NeuralRemaster: Phase-Preserving Diffusion for Structure-Aligned Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05106v1)
**Authors:** Yu Zeng, Charles Ochoa, Mingyuan Zhou et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-04  
**Updated:** 2025-12-04  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG, cs.RO  

**Abstract:** Standard diffusion corrupts data using Gaussian noise whose Fourier coefficients have random magnitudes and random phases. While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Pha...

**Updated:** 2025-12-04  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Gradient-based iterative optimization methods are the workhorse of modern machine learning. They crucially rely on careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and momentum. However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of th...

**Abstract:** We study finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions described by Lindblad dynamics. We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universal...

At tree level, Magnus amplitudes are expressed in terms of retarded and advanced propagators, wit...
