**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectroscopy captures the chiroptical response of molecules, enabling absolute configuration assignment that is vital for enantioselective synthesis and drug design. The practical use of ECD spectra in predictive modeling remains restricted, as existing approaches offer limited confidence for chiral discrimination. By contrast, theoretical ECD calculations deman...

### [Classical Benchmarks of a Symmetry-Adapted Variational Quantum Eigensolver for Real-Time Green's Functions in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03843v1)
**Authors:** Aadi Singh, Chakradhar Rangi, Ka-Ming Tam  
**Published:** 2026-02-03  
**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cond-mat.mtrl-sci, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We present a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approach for solving the Anderson Impurity Model (AIM) arising in Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT). Recognizing that the minimal two-site approximation often fails to resolve essential spectral features, we investigate the efficacy of VQE for larger bath discretizations while adhering to near-term hardware constraints. We employ a symmetry-adapt...

### [Accelerating qubit reset through the Mpemba effect](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03765v1)
**Authors:** Théo Lejeune, Miha Papič, John Goold et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-03  
**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech  

**Abstract:** Passive qubit reset is a key primitive for quantum information processing, whereby qubits are initialized by allowing them to relax to their ground state through natural dissipation, without the need for active control or feedback. However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic exec...

### [PLATE: Plasticity-Tunable Efficient Adapters for Geometry-Aware Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03846v1)
**Authors:** Romain Cosentino  
**Published:** 2026-02-03  
**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We develop a continual learning method for pretrained models that \emph{requires no access to old-task data}, addressing a practical barrier in foundation model adaptation where pretraining distributions are often unavailable. Our key observation is that pretrained networks exhibit substantial \emph{geometric redundancy}, and that this redundancy can be exploited in two complementary ways. First, ...

**Published:** 2026-02-03  
**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** stat.ML, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We introduce a new preference-based framework for conditional treatment effect estimation and policy learning, built on the Conditional Preference-based Treatment Effect (CPTE). CPTE requires only that outcomes be ranked under a preference rule, unlocking flexible modeling of heterogeneous effects with multivariate, ordinal, or preference-driven outcomes. This unifies applications such as conditio...

**Published:** 2026-02-03  
**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Imbalanced node classification in graph neural networks (GNNs) happens when some labels are much more common than others, which causes the model to learn unfairly and perform badly on the less common classes. To solve this problem, we propose a Curriculum-Guided Feature Learning and Three-Stage Attention Network (CL3AN-GNN), a learning network that uses a three-step attention system (Engage, Enact...

**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** cs.DC, cs.AI, math.NA, math.OC  

**Abstract:** Modern distributed optimization methods mostly rely on traditional synchronous approaches, despite substantial recent progress in asynchronous optimization. We revisit Synchronous SGD and its robust variant, called $m$-Synchronous SGD, and theoretically show that they are nearly optimal in many heterogeneous computation scenarios, which is somewhat unexpected. We analyze the synchronous methods un...

**Published:** 2026-02-03  
**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Designing provably safe control is a core problem in trustworthy autonomy. However, most prior work in this regard assumes either that the system dynamics are known or deterministic, or that the state and action space are finite, significantly limiting application scope. We address this limitation by developing a probabilistic verification framework for unknown dynamical systems which combines con...

**Abstract:** We present a new paradigm for creating random features to approximate bi-variate functions (in particular, kernels) defined on general manifolds. This new mechanism of Manifold Random Features (MRFs) leverages discretization of the manifold and the recently introduced technique of Graph Random Features (GRFs) to learn continuous fields on manifolds. Those fields are used to find continuous approxi...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Modern AI agents such as large language models are trained on diverse tasks -- translation, code generation, mathematical reasoning, and text prediction -- simultaneously. A key question is to quantify how each individual training task influences performance on a target task, a problem we refer to as task attribution. The direct approach, leave-one-out retraining, measures the effect of removing e...

**Abstract:** Tail-end risk measures such as static conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) are used in safety-critical applications to prevent rare, yet catastrophic events. Unlike risk-neutral objectives, the static CVaR of the return depends on entire trajectories without admitting a recursive Bellman decomposition in the underlying Markov decision process. A classical resolution relies on state augmentation with a...

**Abstract:** Quantum-Induced Stochastic Dynamics arises from the coupling between a classical system and a quantum environment. Unlike standard thermal reservoirs, this environment acts as a dynamic bath, capable of simultaneously exchanging heat and performing work. We formulate a thermodynamic framework for this semi-classical regime, defining heat, work, and entropy production. We derive a modified Second L...

**Categories:** hep-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** In the three-flavor neutrino oscillation framework, we investigate the transition probabilities of an initial muon neutrino flavor state in the presence of non-standard interactions (NSIs) characterized by complex off-diagonal ($|ε_{αβ}|e^{iφ_{αβ}}$) and diagonal parameters ($|ε_{αα}-ε_{ββ}|$), including a CP-violating phase and a constant matter potential, under both normal (NO) and inverted mass...

### [Detecting quantum noise of a solid-state spin ensemble with dispersive measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03734v1)
**Authors:** Mikhail Mamaev, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman, Martin Koppenhöfer et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-03

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We theoretically explore protocols for measuring the spin polarization of an ensemble of solid-state spins, with precision at or below the standard quantum limit. Such measurements in the solid-state are challenging, as standard approaches based on optical fluorescence are often limited by poor readout fidelity. Indirect microwave resonator-mediated measurements provide an attractive alternative, ...

### [Efficient Training of Boltzmann Generators Using Off-Policy Log-Dispersion Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03729v1)
**Authors:** Henrik Schopmans, Christopher von Klitzing, Pascal Friederich

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Sampling from unnormalized probability densities is a central challenge in computational science. Boltzmann generators are generative models that enable independent sampling from the Boltzmann distribution of physical systems at a given temperature. However, their practical success depends on data-efficient training, as both simulation data and target energy evaluations are costly. To this end, we...

### [Distributed Phase-Insensitive Displacement Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03727v1)

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Distributed quantum sensing leverages quantum correlations among multiple sensors to enhance the precision of parameter estimation beyond classical limits. Most existing approaches target phase estimation and rely on a shared phase reference between the signal and the probe, yet many relevant scenarios deal with regimes where such a reference is absent, making the estimation of force or field ampl...

### [Thermodynamics of the Heisenberg XXX chain with negative spin](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03714v1)
**Authors:** Rong Zhong, Yang-Yang Chen, Kun Hao et al.

**Abstract:** We study the thermodynamics of the isotropic Heisenberg XXX spin chain with negative spin, focusing on the case $s=-1$. The model is equivalent to the quantum lattice nonlinear Schrödinger (NLS) model and appears as an effective theory in deep inelastic scattering in high-energy quantum chromodynamics. Owing to its integrability, it admits a consistent Bethe Ansatz description and a well-defined t...

### [Universal Characterization of Quantum Vacuum Measurement Engines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03706v1)

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum measurements can inject energy into quantum systems, enabling engines whose operation is powered entirely by measurements. We develop a general theory of quantum vacuum measurement engines by introducing the quantum vacuum bending function (QVBF), a quantity that characterizes the lowering of the ground-state energy due to interactions. We show that all thermodynamic observables, including...

### [Anti-Critical Quantum Metrology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03675v1)
**Authors:** George Mihailescu, Karol Gietka  
**Published:** 2026-02-03  
**Updated:** 2026-02-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Critical quantum metrology exploits the dramatic growth of the quantum Fisher information near quantum phase transitions to enhance the precision of parameter estimation. Traditionally, this enhancement is associated with a closing energy gap, which causes the characteristic timescales for adiabatic preparation or relaxation to diverge with increasing system size. Consequently, the apparent growth...
