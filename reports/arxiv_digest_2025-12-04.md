### [Phase-space open-systems dynamics of second-order nonlinear interactions with pulsed quantum light](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03933v1)
**Authors:** Emanuel Hubenschmid, Victor Rueskov Christiansen  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The theoretical description of broadband, multimode quantum pulses undergoing a second-order $χ^{(2)}$-nonlinear interaction can be quite intricate, due to the large dimensionality of the underlying phase space. However, in many cases only a few broadband (temporal) modes are relevant before and after the nonlinear interaction. Here we present an efficient framework to calculate the relation betwe...

### [Rethinking Collapse: Coupling Quantum States to Classical Bits with quasi-probabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03929v1)
**Authors:** Dagomir Kaszlikowski, Pawel Kurzynski  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We propose a formulation of quantum measurement within a modified framework of frames, in which a quantum system - a single qubit - is directly coupled to a classical measurement bit. The qubit is represented as a positive probability distribution over two classical bits, a and a', denoted by p(aa'). The measurement apparatus is described by a classical bit $α= \pm 1$, initialized in the pure dist...

### [Towards Quantum Stochastic Optimization for Energy Systems under Uncertainty: Joint Chance Constraints with Quantum Annealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03925v1)
**Authors:** David Ribes, Tatiana Gonzalez Grandon  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Uncertainty is fundamental in modern power systems, where renewable generation and fluctuating demand make stochastic optimization indispensable. The chance constrained unit commitment problem (UCP) captures this uncertainty but rapidly becomes computationally challenging as the number of scenarios grows. Quantum computing has been proposed as a potential route to overcome such scaling barriers. I...

### [SkillFactory: Self-Distillation For Learning Cognitive Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04072v1)
**Authors:** Zayne Sprague, Jack Lu, Manya Wadhwa et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Reasoning models leveraging long chains of thought employ various cognitive skills, such as verification of their answers, backtracking, retrying by an alternate method, and more. Previous work has shown that when a base language model exhibits these skills, training that model further with reinforcement learning (RL) can learn to leverage them. How can we get models to leverage skills that aren't...

### [Learning Steerable Clarification Policies with Collaborative Self-play](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04068v1)
**Authors:** Jonathan Berant, Maximillian Chen, Adam Fisch et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** To handle underspecified or ambiguous queries, AI assistants need a policy for managing their uncertainty to determine (a) when to guess the user intent and answer directly, (b) when to enumerate and answer multiple possible intents, and (c) when to ask a clarifying question. However, such policies are contextually dependent on factors such as user preferences or modality. For example, enumerating...

### [Instantaneous Sobolev Regularization for Dissipative Bosonic Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04066v1)
**Authors:** Pablo Costa Rico, Paul Gondolf, Tim Möbus  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** math-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We investigate quantum Markov semigroups on bosonic Fock space and identify a broad class of infinite-dimensional dissipative evolutions that exhibit instantaneous Sobolev-regularization. Motivated by stability problems in quantum computation, we show that for certain Lindblad operators that are polynomials of creation and annihilation operators, the resulting dynamics immediately transform any in...

**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG, math.ST  

**Abstract:** The discovery of Bell that there exist quantum correlations that cannot be reproduced classically is one of the most important in the foundations of quantum mechanics, as well as having practical implications. Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure w...

### [Convergence for Discrete Parameter Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04051v1)
**Authors:** Paul Wilson, Fabio Zanasi, George Constantinides  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC  

**Abstract:** Modern deep learning models require immense computational resources, motivating research into low-precision training. Quantised training addresses this by representing training components in low-bit integers, but typically relies on discretising real-valued updates. We introduce an alternative approach where the update rule itself is discrete, avoiding the quantisation of continuous updates by des...

**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** econ.GN, cs.AI, cs.CY  

**Abstract:** In democracies, major policy decisions typically require some form of majority or consensus, so elites must secure mass support to govern. Historically, elites could shape support only through limited instruments like schooling and mass media; advances in AI-driven persuasion sharply reduce the cost and increase the precision of shaping public opinion, making the distribution of preferences itself...

**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CR  

**Abstract:** Watermarking aims to embed hidden signals in generated text that can be reliably detected when given access to a secret key. Open-weight language models pose acute challenges for such watermarking schemes because the inference-time interventions that dominate contemporary approaches cannot be enforced once model weights are public. Existing watermaking techniques for open-weight models, such as th...

### [Domain Feature Collapse: Implications for Out-of-Distribution Detection and Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04034v1)
**Authors:** Hong Yang, Devroop Kar, Qi Yu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Why do state-of-the-art OOD detection methods exhibit catastrophic failure when models are trained on single-domain datasets? We provide the first theoretical explanation for this phenomenon through the lens of information theory. We prove that supervised learning on single-domain data inevitably produces domain feature collapse -- representations where I(x_d; z) = 0, meaning domain-specific infor...

### [Thermalization from quenching in coupled oscillators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04028v1)
**Authors:** M. Harinarayanan, Karthik Rajeev  
**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce a finite-time protocol that thermalizes a quantum harmonic oscillator, initially in its ground state, without requiring a macroscopic bath. The method uses a second oscillator as an effective environment and implements sudden quenches of the oscillator frequencies and coupling. Owing to the Gaussian nature of the dynamics, the thermalization condition reduces to three solvable equatio...

**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG, math.OC, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Cross-entropy (CE) training loss dominates deep learning practice, yet existing theory often relies on simplifications, either replacing it with squared loss or restricting to convex models, that miss essential behavior. CE and squared loss generate fundamentally different dynamics, and convex linear models cannot capture the complexities of non-convex optimization. We provide an in-depth characte...

**Published:** 2025-12-03  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Traffic state estimation (TSE) becomes challenging when probe-vehicle penetration is low and observations are spatially sparse. Pure data-driven methods lack physical explanations and have poor generalization when observed data is sparse. In contrast, physical models have difficulty integrating uncertainties and capturing the real complexity of traffic. To bridge this gap, recent studies have expl...
