### [Protocols for a many-body phase microscope: From coherences and d-wave superconductivity to Green's functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12142v1)
**Authors:** Christof Weitenberg, Luca Asteria, Ola Carlsson et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cond-mat.quant-gas, cond-mat.str-el, physics.atom-ph, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum gas microscopes probe quantum many-body lattice states via projective measurements in the occupation basis, enabling access to various density and spin correlations. Phase information, however, cannot be directly obtained in these setups. Recent experiments went beyond this by measuring local current operators and local phase fluctuations. Here we propose how Fourier-space manipulation in ...

**Authors:** Riko Schadow, Naomi Spier, Stefan N. van den Hoven et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Certification is important to guarantee the correct functioning of quantum devices. A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum ...

### [Function-Space Decoupled Diffusion for Forward and Inverse Modeling in Carbon Capture and Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12274v1)
**Authors:** Xin Ju, Jiachen Yao, Anima Anandkumar et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG, physics.geo-ph  

**Abstract:** Accurate characterization of subsurface flow is critical for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) but remains challenged by the ill-posed nature of inverse problems with sparse observations. We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribut...

### [MonarchRT: Efficient Attention for Real-Time Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12271v1)
**Authors:** Krish Agarwal, Zhuoming Chen, Cheng Luo et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Real-time video generation with Diffusion Transformers is bottlenecked by the quadratic cost of 3D self-attention, especially in real-time regimes that are both few-step and autoregressive, where errors compound across time and each denoising step must carry substantially more information. In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong result...

### [Self-Supervised Learning via Flow-Guided Neural Operator on Time-Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12267v1)
**Authors:** Duy Nguyen, Jiachen Yao, Jiayun Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a powerful paradigm for learning from unlabeled time-series data. However, popular methods such as masked autoencoders (MAEs) rely on reconstructing inputs from a fixed, predetermined masking ratio. Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. ...

### [Learning to Forget Attention: Memory Consolidation for Adaptive Compute Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12204v1)
**Authors:** Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Hybrid architectures combining state-space models with attention have achieved strong efficiency-quality tradeoffs, yet existing approaches either apply attention uniformly or learn static sparse patterns. This misses a key opportunity: \emph{attention demand should decrease over time as recurring patterns become familiar}. We present a surprising finding from analyzing GPT-2 models: \textbf{88\%}...

### [Post-measurement states are (very) useful for measurement discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12258v1)
**Authors:** Charbel Eid, Marco Túlio Quintino  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The standard approach to quantum measurement discrimination is to perform the given unknown measurement on a probe state, possibly entangled with an auxiliary system, and make a decision based on the measurement outcome obtained. In this work, we go beyond the standard aforementioned scenarios by consider not only the classical measurement outcome of a measurement, but also its the post-measuremen...

### [Non-Abelian Quantum Low-Density Parity Check Codes and Non-Clifford Operations from Gauging Logical Gates via Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12228v1)
**Authors:** Maine Christos, Chiu Fan Bowen Lo, Vedika Khemani et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.str-el  

**Abstract:** In this work, we introduce constructions for non-Abelian qLDPC codes obtained by gauging transversal Clifford gates using measurement and feedback. In particular, we identify two qualitatively different approaches to gauging qLDPC codes to obtain their non-Abelian counterparts. The first approach applies to codes that exhibit a generalized form of Poincaré duality and leads to a qLDPC non-Abelian ...

### [Scaling Verification Can Be More Effective than Scaling Policy Learning for Vision-Language-Action Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12281v1)
**Authors:** Jacky Kwok, Xilun Zhang, Mengdi Xu et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, eess.SY  

**Abstract:** The long-standing vision of general-purpose robots hinges on their ability to understand and act upon natural language instructions. Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have made remarkable progress toward this goal, yet their generated actions can still misalign with the given instructions. In this paper, we investigate test-time verification as a means to shrink the "intention-action gap.'' We f...

### [UniT: Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Test-time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12279v1)
**Authors:** Leon Liangyu Chen, Haoyu Ma, Zhipeng Fan et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Unified models can handle both multimodal understanding and generation within a single architecture, yet they typically operate in a single pass without iteratively refining their outputs. Many multimodal tasks, especially those involving complex spatial compositions, multiple interacting objects, or evolving instructions, require decomposing instructions, verifying intermediate results, and makin...

**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.IR, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has been widely adopted to help Large Language Models (LLMs) to process tasks involving long documents. However, existing retrieval models are not designed for long document retrieval and fail to address several key challenges of long document retrieval, including context-awareness, causal dependence, and scope of retrieval. In this paper, we proposed Attention...

### [Agentic Test-Time Scaling for WebAgents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12276v1)
**Authors:** Nicholas Lee, Lutfi Eren Erdogan, Chris Joseph John et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Test-time scaling has become a standard way to improve performance and boost reliability of neural network models. However, its behavior on agentic, multi-step tasks remains less well-understood: small per-step errors can compound over long horizons; and we find that naive policies that uniformly increase sampling show diminishing returns. In this work, we present CATTS, a simple technique for dyn...

**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** math.OC, cs.LG, math.NA  

**Abstract:** We propose an optimization-informed deep neural network approach, named iUzawa-Net, aiming for the first solver that enables real-time solutions for a class of nonsmooth optimal control problems of linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The iUzawa-Net unrolls an inexact Uzawa method for saddle point problems, replacing classical preconditioners and PDE solvers with specifically designed lea...

**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** econ.TH, cs.AI, cs.GT  

**Abstract:** Copyright law focuses on whether a new work is "substantially similar" to an existing one, but generative AI can closely imitate style without copying content, a capability now central to ongoing litigation. We argue that existing definitions of infringement are ill-suited to this setting and propose a new criterion: a generative AI output infringes on an existing work if it could not have been ge...

### [CM2: Reinforcement Learning with Checklist Rewards for Multi-Turn and Multi-Step Agentic Tool Use](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12268v1)
**Authors:** Zhen Zhang, Kaiqiang Song, Xun Wang et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building ...

### [Repulsive Gravitational Force as a Witness of the Quantum Nature of Gravity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12266v1)
**Authors:** Pablo L. Saldanha, Chiara Marletto, Vlatko Vedral  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph, gr-qc  

**Abstract:** We show that a single spatially superposed 'source' mass acting on a 'probe' matter wavepacket can reveal the quantum nature of the gravitational field. For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lea...

**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Diffusion large language models (DLLMs) have the potential to enable fast text generation by decoding multiple tokens in parallel. However, in practice, their inference efficiency is constrained by the need for many refinement steps, while aggressively reducing the number of steps leads to a substantial degradation in generation quality. To alleviate this, we propose a trajectory self-distillation...

### [On the implicit regularization of Langevin dynamics with projected noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12257v1)
**Authors:** Govind Menon, Austin J. Stromme, Adrien Vacher  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** math.PR, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We study Langevin dynamics with noise projected onto the directions orthogonal to an isometric group action. This mathematical model is introduced to shed new light on the effects of symmetry on stochastic gradient descent for over-parametrized models. Our main result identifies a novel form of implicit regularization: when the initial and target density are both invariant under the group action, ...

**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.GT, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We consider bidding in repeated Bayesian first-price auctions. Bidding algorithms that achieve optimal regret have been extensively studied, but their strategic robustness to the seller's manipulation remains relatively underexplored. Bidding algorithms based on no-swap-regret algorithms achieve both desirable properties, but are suboptimal in terms of statistical and computational efficiency. In ...

**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CY  

**Abstract:** Despite speech recognition systems achieving low word error rates on standard benchmarks, they often fail on short, high-stakes utterances in real-world deployments. Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically divers...

**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Diffusion alignment adapts pretrained diffusion models to sample from reward-tilted distributions along the denoising trajectory. This process naturally admits a Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) interpretation, where the denoising model acts as a proposal and reward guidance induces importance weights. Motivated by this view, we introduce Variance Minimisation Policy Optimisation (VMPO), which formula...

**Abstract:** Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but often yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \textbf{\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between da...

### [The Observer Effect in World Models: Invasive Adaptation Corrupts Latent Physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12218v1)
**Authors:** Christian Internò, Jumpei Yamaguchi, Loren Amdahl-Culleton et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Determining whether neural models internalize physical laws as world models, rather than exploiting statistical shortcuts, remains challenging, especially under out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts. Standard evaluations often test latent capability via downstream adaptation (e.g., fine-tuning or high-capacity probes), but such interventions can change the representations being measured and thus confou...

### [Quantum-Coherent Thermodynamics: Leaf Typicality via Minimum-Variance Foliation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12212v1)
**Authors:** Maurizio Fagotti  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cond-mat.stat-mech, math-ph  

**Abstract:** Equilibrium statistical ensembles commute with the Hamiltonian and thus carry no coherence in the energy eigenbasis. We develop a thermodynamic framework in which energy fluctuations can retain genuinely quantum-coherent contributions. We foliate state space into "minimum-variance leaves," defined by minimizing the average energy variance over all pure-state decompositions, with the minimum set by...

**Categories:** cs.HC, cs.AI, cs.SI  

**Abstract:** Digital platforms shape how people communicate, deliberate, and form opinions. Studying these dynamics has become increasingly difficult due to restricted data access, ethical constraints on real-world experiments, and limitations of existing research tools. VIRENA (Virtual Arena) is a platform that enables controlled experimentation in realistic social media environments. Multiple participants in...

### [A Framework for Spatial Quantum Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12193v1)
**Authors:** Luís Bugalho, Yasser Omar, Damian Markham  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Analytical and algebraic geometry are valuable tools for dealing with problems involving analytical functions and polynomials. In what we connote as spatial quantum sensing the goal is, given an underlying field and a set of quantum sensors interrogating the field in a set of positions, to find an estimator for some property the field. This property can have multiple forms, be it distinguishing th...

**Categories:** cond-mat.stat-mech, hep-th, quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The charged moments of a reduced density matrix provide a natural starting point for deriving symmetry-resolved Rényi and entanglement entropies, which quantify how entanglement is distributed among symmetry sectors in the presence of a global internal symmetry in a quantum many-body system. In this work, we study charged moments within the framework of Ballistic Fluctuation Theory (BFT). This the...

### [Deterministic Generation of Arbitrary Fock States via Resonant Subspace Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12156v1)
**Authors:** Shan Jin, Ming Li, Weizhou Cai et al.  
**Published:** 2026-02-12  
**Updated:** 2026-02-12  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Deterministic preparation of high-excitation Fock states is a central challenge in bosonic quantum information, with control complexity that generically explodes as the Hilbert space dimension grows. Here we introduce resonant subspace engineering (RSE), a protocol that analytically confines the infinite-dimensional bosonic dynamics to a two-dimensional invariant subspace spanned by an initial coh...

**Categories:** quant-ph, physics.atom-ph  

**Abstract:** Scalable quantum computers and quantum networks require the combination of quantum processing nodes with efficient light-matter interfaces to distribute quantum information in local or long-distance quantum networks. Neutral-atom arrays have both been coupled to Rydberg states to enable high-fidelity quantum gates in universal processing architectures, and to optical cavities to realize interfaces...

**Abstract:** Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are revolutionizing the forecasting landscape from specific dataset modeling to generalizable task evaluation.

**Abstract:** Spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity are traditionally described by unitary holonomies corresponding to noiseless transformations. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define complet...
