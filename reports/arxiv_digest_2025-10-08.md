### [Overshifted Parameter-Shift Rules: Optimizing Complex Quantum Systems with Few Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05289v1)
**Authors:** Leonardo Banchi, Dominic Branford, Chetan Waghela  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Gradient-based optimization is a key ingredient of variational quantum algorithms, with applications ranging from quantum machine learning to quantum chemistry and simulation. The parameter-shift rule provides a hardware-friendly method for evaluating gradients of expectation values with respect to circuit parameters, but its applicability is limited to circuits whose gate generators have a partic...

**Categories:** cs.LG, physics.comp-ph  

**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer (S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two key issues; 1. the redundancy...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** We present a new primitive for quantum algorithms that implements a discrete Hermite transform efficiently, in time that depends logarithmically in both the dimension and the inverse of the allowable error. This transform, which maps basis states to states whose amplitudes are proportional to the Hermite functions, can be interpreted as the Gaussian analogue of the Fourier transform. Our algorithm...

### [Closed-Form Last Layer Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04606v1)
**Authors:** Alexandre Galashov, Nathaël Da Costa, Liyuan Xu et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-06  
**Updated:** 2025-10-06  
**Categories:** cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** Neural networks are typically optimized with variants of stochastic gradient descent. Under a squared loss, however, the optimal solution to the linear last layer weights is known in closed-form. We propose to leverage this during optimization, treating the last layer as a function of the backbone parameters, and optimizing solely for these parameters. We show this is equivalent to alternating bet...

**Updated:** 2025-10-07  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** High-rate quantum LDPC (qLDPC) codes reduce memory overhead by densely packing many logical qubits into a single block of physical qubits. Here we extend this concept to high-rate computation by constructing \emph{batched} fault-tolerant operations that apply the same logical gate across many code blocks in parallel. By leveraging shared physical resources to execute many logical operations in par...

**Abstract:** Time series foundation models (TSFMs) are increasingly being adopted as highly-capable general-purpose time series representation learners. Although their training corpora are vast, they exclude astronomical time series data. Observations of stars produce peta-scale time series with unique challenges including irregular sampling and heteroskedasticity. We introduce StarEmbed, the first public benc...

**Abstract:** Auto-regressive speech-text models are typically pre-trained on a large number of interleaved sequences of text tokens and raw speech encoded as speech tokens using vector quantization. These models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in speech-to-speech understanding and generation benchmarks, together with promising scaling laws, primarily enabled by the representational alignment bet...

**Authors:** Audrey Cheng, Shu Liu, Melissa Pan et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-07

**Categories:** cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Artificial Intelligence (AI) is starting to transform the research process as we know it by automating the discovery of new solutions. Given a task, the typical AI-driven approach is (i) to generate a set of diverse solutions, and then (ii) to verify these solutions and select one that solves the problem. Crucially, this approach assumes the existence of a reliable verifier, i.e., one that can acc...

**Abstract:** Real-time speech assistants are becoming increasingly popular for ensuring improved accessibility to information. Bengali, being a low-resource language with a high regional dialectal diversity, has seen limited progress in developing such systems. Existing systems are not optimized for real-time use and focus only on standard Bengali. In this work, we present BanglaTalk, the first real-time speec...

**Abstract:** Any reasonable measure of distinguishability of quantum states must satisfy a data processing inequality, that is, it must not increase under the action of a quantum channel. We can ask about the proportion of information lost or preserved and this leads us to study contraction and expansion coefficients respectively, which can be combined into a single \emph{relative expansion coefficient} for st...

**Abstract:** Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However, such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational complexity, but also the strict ...

**Abstract:** In climate science, the tuning of climate models is a computationally intensive problem due to the combination of the high-dimensionality of the system state and long integration times. Here we demonstrate the potential of a parameter estimation algorithm which makes use of synchronization to tune a global atmospheric model at modest computational costs.

**Abstract:** Differentiable model predictive control (MPC) offers a powerful framework for combining learning and control.

**Abstract:** We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic dataset and investi...

**Abstract:** We investigate the hierarchy of quantum correlations in a quadratic bosonic parity-time-symmetric system (PTSS) featuring distinct dissipation and amplification channels.

Their interpretation is straightforward when features act independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature contributions.

**Abstract:** A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability.

**Abstract:** Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters, namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across different gra...
