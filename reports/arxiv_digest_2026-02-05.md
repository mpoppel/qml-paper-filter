### [Pre-optimization of quantum circuits, barren plateaus and classical simulability: tensor networks to unlock the variational quantum eigensolver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04676v1)
**Authors:** Baptiste Anselme Martin, Thomas Ayral  
**Published:** 2026-02-04  
**Updated:** 2026-02-04  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Variational quantum algorithms are practical approaches to prepare ground states, but their potential for quantum advantage remains unclear. Here, we use differentiable 2D tensor networks (TN) to optimize parameterized quantum circuits that prepare the ground state of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM). Our method enables the preparation of states with high energy accuracy, even for large sys...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.CC  

**Abstract:** The analysis of the computational power of single-query quantum algorithms is important because they must extract maximal information from one oracle call, revealing fundamental limits of quantum advantage and enabling optimal, resource-efficient quantum computation. This paper proposes a formulation of single-query quantum decision trees as weighted graphs. This formulation has the advantage that...

### [Ising-Induced Spectral Broadening Resolves the Relaxation Bottleneck in Superradiant Masers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04721v1)
**Authors:** Hongze Ding, Jiuqing Liang  
**Published:** 2026-02-04  
**Updated:** 2026-02-04  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The recent observation of self-induced superradiant masing [[W. Kersten et al., Nat. Phys. 22, 158 (2026)]] revealed a collective relaxation timescale significantly slower than predicted by standard coherent transport models. Here, we elucidate the microscopic origin of this ``relaxation bottleneck.'' We show that in the high-density regime relevant to the experiment, diagonal Ising interactions -...

**Published:** 2026-02-04  
**Updated:** 2026-02-04  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CL  

**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a cornerstone for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) serving as the de facto standard algorithm. Despite its ubiquity, we argue that the core ratio clipping mechanism in PPO is structurally ill-suited for the large vocabularies inherent to LLMs. PPO constrains policy updates based on the probability ratio of samp...

**Published:** 2026-02-04  
**Updated:** 2026-02-04  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** We introduce a propagation-based approach to thermal state simulation by adapting Pauli and Majorana propagation to imaginary-time evolution in the Schrödinger picture. Our key observation is that high-temperature states can be sparse in the Pauli or Majorana bases, approaching the identity at infinite temperature. By formulating imaginary-time evolution directly in these operator bases and evolvi...

**Published:** 2026-02-04  
**Updated:** 2026-02-04  
**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Linear attention offers a computationally efficient yet expressive alternative to softmax attention. However, recent empirical results indicate that the state of trained linear attention models often exhibits a low-rank structure, suggesting that these models underexploit their capacity in practice. To illuminate this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis of the role of rank in linear atte...

**Abstract:** Gradient-variation online learning has drawn increasing attention due to its deep connections to game theory, optimization, etc. It has been studied extensively in the full-information setting, but is underexplored with bandit feedback. In this work, we focus on gradient variation in Bandit Convex Optimization (BCO) with two-point feedback. By proposing a refined analysis on the non-consecutive gr...

### [Quantifying the Operational Cost of Multipartite Entanglement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04760v1)

**Abstract:** Multipartite entanglement determines the strength and range of interactions in many-body quantum systems. Yet, it is hard to evaluate it, due to the complex structures of quantum states. Here, we introduce a generic method to quantify the k <= N-partite entanglement of an N-particle system, by maximizing an arbitrary bipartite entanglement measure within subsystems of size up to k. The resulting c...

**Categories:** cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Multi-source precipitation products (MSPs) from satellite retrievals and reanalysis are widely used for hydroclimatic monitoring, yet spatially heterogeneous biases and limited skill for extremes still constrain their hydrologic utility. Here we develop a dual-stage TransUNet-based multi-source precipitation merging framework (DDL-MSPMF) that integrates six MSPs with four ERA5 near-surface physica...

### [Generalized quantum theory for accessing nonlinear systems: the case of Levinson-Smith equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04747v1)
**Authors:** Bijan Bagchi, Anindya Ghose-Choudhury  
**Published:** 2026-02-04

**Abstract:** Motivated by a recently developed generalized scheme of quantum mechanics, we touch upon connections with Levinson-Smith classes of nonlinear systems that contain as a particular case the Liénard family of differential equations. The latter, which has coefficients of odd and odd symmetry, admits a closed form solution when converted to the Abel form. Analysis of the governing condition shows that ...

**Abstract:** Digitized adiabatic quantum factorization is a hybrid algorithm that exploits the advantage of digitized quantum computers to implement efficient adiabatic algorithms for factorization through gate decompositions of analog evolutions. In this paper, we harness the flexibility of digitized computers to derive a digitized adiabatic algorithm able to reduce the gate-demanding costs of implementing fa...
