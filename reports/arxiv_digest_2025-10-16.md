**Abstract:** A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotempo...

**Abstract:** The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces. Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but where transition dynamics a...

**Abstract:** Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunab...

To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays, allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our method employs a lightweight l...

**Abstract:** The study of quantum reference frames has received renewed interest over the last years, leading to the parallel development of non-equivalent frameworks by different communities. We clarify the differences between these frameworks. At the mathematical level, they mainly differ in the kind of symmetry (either weak or strong) employed to constrain the system. We show that this mathematical differen...

**Abstract:** We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse} (bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if $f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mat...

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision ...
