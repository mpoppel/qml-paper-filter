### [Enhancing Hybrid Methods in Parameterized Quantum Circuit Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08142v1)
**Authors:** Joona V. Pankkonen, Matti Raasakka, Andrea Marchesin et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-09  
**Updated:** 2025-10-09  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) play an essential role in the application of variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. The PQCs are a leading candidate to achieve a quantum advantage in NISQ devices and have already been applied in various domains such as quantum chemistry, quantum machine learning, combinatorial optimization, and many others. ...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Randomized quantum algorithms have been proposed in the context of quantum simulation and quantum linear algebra with the goal of constructing shallower circuits than methods based on block encodings. While the algorithmic complexities of such randomized schemes have been shown to be suboptimal, it has been speculated that they may offer benefits in the early fault-tolerant era where circuit depth...

**Abstract:** Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine (GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier feature mappings (FFMs) a...

**Published:** 2025-10-12  
**Updated:** 2025-10-12  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box", where users cannot know how the...

Our method combine...

**Abstract:** A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the spatiotempo...

**Abstract:** Amortized simulator-based inference offers a powerful framework for tackling Bayesian inference in computational fields such as engineering or neuroscience, increasingly leveraging modern generative methods like diffusion models to map observed data to model parameters or future predictions. These approaches yield posterior or posterior-predictive samples for new datasets without requiring further...

**Abstract:** Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data. Conversely, less expensive, low-...

**Abstract:** A fundamental problem in statistics is estimating the shape matrix of an Elliptical distribution. This generalizes the familiar problem of Gaussian covariance estimation, for which the sample covariance achieves optimal estimation error. For Elliptical distributions, Tyler proposed a natural M-estimator and showed strong statistical properties in the asymptotic regime, independent of the underlyin...

**Abstract:** The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces. Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but where transition dynamics a...

**Abstract:** Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN) and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step scale can l...

**Abstract:** Two-dimensional (2D) dipolar atomic gases present unique opportunities for exploring novel quantum phases due to their anisotropic and long-range interactions. However, the behavior of strongly dipolar Bose gases in 2D remains unclear, especially when dipoles are tilted. Here, we demonstrate the creation and characterization of strongly dipolar 2D condensates in a quasi-2D harmonic trap with tunab...

**Abstract:** Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full retraining, which is consider...

**Abstract:** Remote inference allows lightweight devices to leverage powerful cloud models. However, communication network latency makes predictions stale and unsuitable for real-time tasks. To address this, we introduce Dedelayed, a delay-corrective method that mitigates arbitrary remote inference delays, allowing the local device to produce low-latency outputs in real time. Our method employs a lightweight l...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** The study of quantum reference frames has received renewed interest over the last years, leading to the parallel development of non-equivalent frameworks by different communities. We clarify the differences between these frameworks. At the mathematical level, they mainly differ in the kind of symmetry (either weak or strong) employed to constrain the system. We show that this mathematical differen...

**Abstract:** Demonstration of quantum advantage for classical machine learning tasks remains a central goal for quantum technologies and artificial intelligence. Two major bottlenecks to this goal are the high dimensionality of practical datasets and limited performance of near-term quantum computers.

**Abstract:** We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse} (bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if $f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mat...

**Abstract:** Which components in transformer language models are responsible for discourse understanding? We hypothesize that sparse computational graphs, termed as discursive circuits, control how models process discourse relations. Unlike simpler tasks, discourse relations involve longer spans and complex reasoning. To make circuit discovery feasible, we introduce a task called Completion under Discourse Rel...

**Abstract:** Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models, which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In this paper, ...

### [Causality $\neq$ Decodability, and Vice Versa: Lessons from Interpreting Counting ViTs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09794v1)

**Published:** 2025-10-10

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship in vision ...

**Abstract:** Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits,...
