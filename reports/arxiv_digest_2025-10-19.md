### [General Fourier Feature Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machine (GFF-PIELM) for High-Frequency PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12293v1)
**Authors:** Fei Ren, Sifan Wang, Pei-Zhi Zhuang et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-14

**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.NE, physics.comp-ph  

**Abstract:** Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine (GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier feature mappings (FFMs) a...

### [Stable but Miscalibrated: A Kantian View on Overconfidence from Filters to Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14925v1)
**Authors:** Akira Okutomi  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We reinterpret Kant's Critique of Pure Reason as a theory of feedback stability, viewing reason as a regulator that keeps inference within the bounds of possible experience. We formalize this intuition via a composite instability index (H-Risk) combining spectral margin, conditioning, temporal sensitivity, and innovation amplification. In linear-Gaussian simulations, higher H-Risk predicts overcon...

### [Reciprocal Space Attention for Learning Long-Range Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13055v1)
**Authors:** Hariharan Ramasubramanian, Alvaro Vazquez-Mayagoitia, Ganesh Sivaraman et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-15  
**Updated:** 2025-10-15  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci, cs.LG, physics.chem-ph, physics.comp-ph  

**Abstract:** Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized the modeling of materials and molecules by directly fitting to ab initio data. However, while these models excel at capturing local and semi-local interactions, they often prove insufficient when an explicit and efficient treatment of long-range interactions is required. To address this limitation, we introduce Reciprocal-Space At...

**Published:** 2025-10-13  
**Updated:** 2025-10-13  
**Categories:** cond-mat.str-el, cs.AI, cs.LG, stat.ML  

**Abstract:** We introduce a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that dramatically accelerates the simulation of quantum many-body systems, a grand challenge in computational science. State-of-the-art methods for these problems are severely limited by $O(N^3)$ computational complexity. Our method avoids this bottleneck, achieving near-linear $O(N \log N)$ scaling per sweep.   Our approach samples a joint ...

### [Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning of LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13328v2)
**Authors:** Nicolas Menet, Aleksandar Terzić, Michael Hersche et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-15  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum reward. Our approach, Th...

**Published:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Translating a general quantum circuit on a specific hardware topology with a reduced set of available gates, also known as transpilation, comes with a substantial increase in the length of the equivalent circuit. Due to decoherence, the quality of the computational outcome can degrade seriously with increasing circuit length. Thus, there is major interest to reduce a quantum circuit to an equivale...

**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Noise in near-term quantum devices limits the timescales over which measurements can be reliably obtained. Existing data-driven extrapolation methods extend the dynamics of quantum observables from measurements, but they cannot guarantee that the recovered model reflects the true dynamics. In this paper, we introduce atomic norm minimization as a framework to certify that a model learned by any al...

**Published:** 2025-10-14  
**Updated:** 2025-10-14  
**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum state preparation remains a dominant cost in many quantum algorithms. We introduce a randomized protocol that fundamentally improves the accuracy-cost trade-off for states with hierarchical amplitude structures, where amplitudes decay exponentially or by a power law with exponent greater than one. Rather than commonly employed deterministically truncating small amplitudes, we prepare an en...

### [Coupled Diffusion Sampling for Training-Free Multi-View Image Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14981v1)
**Authors:** Hadi Alzayer, Yunzhi Zhang, Chen Geng et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** We present an inference-time diffusion sampling method to perform multi-view consistent image editing using pre-trained 2D image editing models. These models can independently produce high-quality edits for each image in a set of multi-view images of a 3D scene or object, but they do not maintain consistency across views. Existing approaches typically address this by optimizing over explicit 3D re...

**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.CV, cs.GR, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** The design of complex machines stands as both a marker of human intelligence and a foundation of engineering practice. Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like loc...

**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Recent image editing models have achieved impressive results while following natural language editing instructions, but they rely on supervised fine-tuning with large datasets of input-target pairs. This is a critical bottleneck, as such naturally occurring pairs are hard to curate at scale. Current workarounds use synthetic training pairs that leverage the zero-shot capabilities of existing model...

**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.CV, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** World models have garnered increasing attention for comprehensive modeling of the real world. However, most existing methods still rely on pixel-aligned representations as the basis for world evolution, neglecting the inherent 3D nature of the physical world. This could undermine the 3D consistency and diminish the modeling efficiency of world models. In this paper, we present Terra, a native 3D w...

### [pi-Flow: Policy-Based Few-Step Generation via Imitation Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14974v1)
**Authors:** Hansheng Chen, Kai Zhang, Hao Tan et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI, cs.CV  

**Abstract:** Few-step diffusion or flow-based generative models typically distill a velocity-predicting teacher into a student that predicts a shortcut towards denoised data. This format mismatch has led to complex distillation procedures that often suffer from a quality-diversity trade-off. To address this, we propose policy-based flow models ($\pi$-Flow). $\pi$-Flow modifies the output layer of a student flo...

**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** This work studies how to adaptively recompute key-value (KV) caches for diffusion large language models (DLMs) to maximize prediction accuracy while minimizing decoding latency. Prior methods' decoders recompute QKV for all tokens at every denoising step and layer, despite KV states changing little across most steps, especially in shallow layers, leading to substantial redundancy. We make three ob...

### [TokDrift: When LLM Speaks in Subwords but Code Speaks in Grammar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14972v1)
**Authors:** Yinxi Li, Yuntian Deng, Pengyu Nie  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.CL, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.PL, cs.SE  

**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this ...

**Categories:** math.GR, math.RT, quant-ph, 20E34 (Primary) 20C15, 20C20, 57R56 (Secondary)  

**Abstract:** In this paper, we consider the properties of finite groups that are witnessed by group invariants arising in the context of Dijkgraaf--Witten theory, a topological quantum field theory, as invariants of surfaces. These invariants can be considered generalizations of the commuting probability, an invariant that has been well studied in the group theory literature.

### [Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14947v1)
**Authors:** Blake Werner, Lizhi Yang, Aaron D. Ames  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.RO, cs.AI, cs.LG, cs.SY, eess.SY  

**Abstract:** Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs...

### [Budget-aware Test-time Scaling via Discriminative Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14913v1)
**Authors:** Kyle Montgomery, Sijun Tan, Yuqi Chen et al.  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.AI, cs.CL, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** Test-time scaling is a powerful strategy for boosting the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks. While state-of-the-art approaches often employ generative verifiers to select the best solution from a pool of candidates, this method incurs prohibitive computational costs, limiting its practicality. In this work, we shift the focus to a more budget-aware paradigm: discrimin...

**Categories:** quant-ph, cs.NI  

**Abstract:** Quantum teleportation enables high-security communications through end-to-end quantum entangled pairs. End-to-end entangled pairs are created by using swapping processes to consume short entangled pairs and generate long pairs. However, due to environmental interference, entangled pairs decohere over time, resulting in low fidelity. Thus, generating entangled pairs at the right time is crucial. Mo...

**Authors:** Geelon So, Yi-An Ma  
**Published:** 2025-10-16  
**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.GT, cs.LG  

**Abstract:** We extend the study of learning in games to dynamics that exhibit non-asymptotic stability. We do so through the notion of uniform stability, which is concerned with equilibria of individually utility-seeking dynamics. Perhaps surprisingly, it turns out to be closely connected to economic properties of collective rationality. Under mild non-degeneracy conditions and up to strategic equivalence, if...

**Categories:** quant-ph  

**Abstract:** Quantum code surgery is a promising technique to perform fault-tolerant computation on quantum low-density parity-check codes. Recent developments have significantly reduced the space overhead of surgery. However, generic surgery operations still require $O(d)$ rounds of repeated syndrome extraction to be made fault-tolerant. In this work, we focus on reducing the time overhead of surgery. We firs...

**Abstract:** On social media, many individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a user's in...

**Abstract:** The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) quantifies information scrambling in quantum systems and serves as a key diagnostic of quantum chaos. In one-body systems with a classical counterpart, the relaxation of the OTOC is governed by Ruelle-Pollicott resonances. For many-body systems lacking a semiclassical limit, recent studies have identified an analogous role played by the Liouvillian spectrum ...

**Updated:** 2025-10-16  
**Categories:** cs.LG, cs.AI  

**Abstract:** In high-stakes AI applications, even a single action can cause irreparable damage. However, nearly all of sequential decision-making theory assumes that all errors are recoverable (e.g., by bounding rewards). Standard bandit algorithms that explore aggressively may cause irreparable damage when this assumption fails. Some prior work avoids irreparable errors by asking for help from a mentor, but a...

**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents, yet their practical utility is fundamentally constrained by a limited context window and state desynchronization resulting from the LLMs' stateless nature and inefficient context management. These limitations lead to unreliable output, unpredictable behavior, and inefficient resource usage, particularly when interacting w...

**Abstract:** We study kernel regression with common rotation-invariant kernels on real datasets including CIFAR-5m, SVHN, and ImageNet. We give a theoretical framework that predicts learning curves (test risk vs. sample size) from only two measurements: the empirical data covariance matrix and an empirical polynomial decomposition of the target function $f_*$. The key new idea is an analytical approximation of...
